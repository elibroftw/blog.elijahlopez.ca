      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34; &gt;TL;DR
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASIC-Resistance PoW Algorithm allows mining on devices not exclusively allocated for mining, without being at as much of a disadvantage to a ASIC-friendly PoW Algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows mining using existing hardware without paying liquidation fees or profit margins to increase hash rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not have perverse incentives for ASIC manufactures; i.e. if an entity can improve ASICs internally,  they only sell it to the public once mining said blockchain becomes less profitable than selling to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Botnets = free hash rate security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOES NOT REQUIRE MARKET CAP TO BE HIGHER FOR AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY (NETWORK SECURITY).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for society, it does not reallocate capital to technology used exclusively for the purpose of mining a single cryptocurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing for profit miners to buy specialized hardware increases their risk of mining a non-defacto cryptocurrency whereas general compute can be reallocated as soon as operational profits drop. With Asics, companies would just stop mining and declare bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34; &gt;Preface
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#preface&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider two coins, where the only difference between the two is that one uses an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm, (called powR), the other is ASIC-friendly (called powF) (definition: it is mined most efficiently by specialized hardware that specializes in said proof-of-work algorithm, and is less effective at other tasks due to the nature of the coin requiring new ASICs to be created). Both have an equal number of not-for-profit miners who invested the same amount of money. e.g. Ryzen CPUs vs ASICs. Without introducing the other miners, the difficulty (measured in total comparable hashrate, TCH) is the same at the moment. One point to note is that network hashrates are usually not comparable between blockchains that use different proof of work algorithms. It&amp;rsquo;s a question of cryptography, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re only interested in the concept of comparable difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-for-profit-miners&#34; &gt;Not For Profit Miners
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-for-profit-miners&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;rsquo;s introduce zero-capex (capital expenditure) not-for-profit miners. These are people who already own the computing hardware and repurpose it to mine the coin. Due to the explicit nature of the ASIC-friendly coin, the TCH of the ASIC-resistant coin is going to go up by a higher percentage. I will prove it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume for every dollar in investment and operational cost, A(ASIC)s are more efficient at mining powF than G(ENERIC) hardware is, and for powR, ASIC is less efficient (and thus does not exist for powR). This is a valid assumption because the definition of powF is to be more efficient using ASICS. Even if powF is unprofitable to mine with A, it would be even more unprofitable to mine with G. Got it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a demonstration. Say the efficiency is 2x. There is older generic hardware G&amp;rsquo;, which is said to be half as efficient as G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 3 miners/pools contributing to each network with the following hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two miners with hardware G&amp;rsquo; (said to be less powerful than G), want to start mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA G&#39;
New difficulty: (6.5:6 = 108.3%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG G&amp;rsquo;:
New difficulty: (3.5:3 = 116.7%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the powF fan will sell their existing hardware for money, which will most probably be done at a discount to its market value, and thus will be buying something that is not exactly half of A. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = $1k
G = $1k
G&amp;rsquo; = $500 (market value)
G&amp;rsquo; sold = $499 (G&amp;rsquo; is not a hot commodity by definition, and must be sold at a discount to market value to get money in hand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that G&amp;rsquo; can be sold for market value, there exists some person with hardware G&amp;rsquo; that wants to use only a % of their hardware for mining. This is true, and so even in the best case scenario, it will be more profitable to mine powR than powF with existing hardware. It actually gets even more insane if you design the most ASIC-friendly algorithm. The greater the efficiency of ASICs at mining powF compared to Generics, the greater the increase in difficulty required from powR before existing hardware users even consider mining powR (from a profitability standpoint). To recap, for not-for-profit users that don&amp;rsquo;t want to dedicate their existing hardware to mine their preferred blockchain, the users of powR will be increasing the difficulty of the respective blockchain by a higher percentage than the users of powF (assuming equal users and equal existing hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34; &gt;Botnets and Cost Advantaged Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With botnets, powR is getting mined more than powF and it&amp;rsquo;s still proportional to how ASIC-friendly powF is. If ASICs are 10x more economically efficient than generic hardware, then botnets are going to prefer powR for 10x more price-adjuated difficulty (i.e. share of TCH * price of powR has to be less than the same calcualtion of powF). Botnets mine powR, and have an incentive to not compromise the network as it is profitable without operational costs. With botnets selling the powR coin for profit, the powR market cap will be going down over time at a rate faster than the powF coin, but the multiplicative rate of defline will not be greater than the difficulty multiplier (otherwise botnets would mine powF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ASIC-resistant algorithm powR has a higher difficulty than the ASIC-friendly algorithm powF, even before we introduce profit-seeking entities. What this also means is that if profit to mine is zero or less, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for a bad actor to take over the ASIC-friendly network than the ASIC-Resistance network (every $ invested represents a higher share of hashrate for the ASIC-friendly blockchain compared to every $ invested in the ASIC-resistance blockchain). &lt;em&gt;Note that in the long-run, due to how relatively low the barriers to entry &lt;del&gt;will be&lt;/del&gt; are to mine blocks, mining profit (excluding speculation) does go to zero.&lt;/em&gt; Even for ASIC-friendly blockchains, since they want ASICs to be created by anyone (and thus accessible to as many people). It&amp;rsquo;s actually worse if ASIC-friendly algorithms don&amp;rsquo;t want ASICs to be easily created. If the market for ASICs are not &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/what-is-perfect-competition&#34;&gt;perfect competition&lt;/a&gt;, the the players in the market can simply gatekeep their ASICs and mine with an advantage, which could also compromise how decentralized the mining is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point, it is less profitable &lt;em&gt;to buy hardware&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of mining powR rather than powF because mining powR would increase difficulty by a smaller percentage than mining powF (assuming the same initial capital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a hostile actor, it is cheaper to attack and take over the powF blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this statement to be false, the assumptions are unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person that would rather mine using their existing hardware than swap it. (hypothetically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swapping generic hardware for specialized hardware has zero loss of capital. (false due to used goods having varied prices and have also depreciated, especially electronics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person who would mine using generic hardware part-time. (false since Monero is proof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the security of a blockchain (difficulty) should not depend on the assumption that the market cap of the blockchain is high enough that state actors can&amp;rsquo;t meaningfully impact the blockchain. Why? Because in the real world, every blockchain grows its market cap over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;profit-seeking-entities&#34; &gt;Profit-Seeking Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#profit-seeking-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two types of profit-seeking entities. One is speculative, which all coins loves, the other is non-speculative and looks at operational profits (that is they sell for fiat immediately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generic-hardware-entities&#34; &gt;Generic Hardware Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#generic-hardware-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For entities (individuals and companies) that already hold generic hardware, they will be checking the relative profitability of each coin. In the instance of dedicated mining, entities will swap generic hardware for specialized hardware, thus increasing difficulty of powF. However, if the profitability is the same between the two coins, the generic hardware entity will always prefer mining powR, because it does not require swapping to ASICs. Thus we can assume that powR still has a higher difficulty than powF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of part-timer generic entities, powR is going to have a higher profit margin as mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;investors&#34; &gt;Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A for-profit entity, ELL&amp;rsquo;s Mining Corporation, is a pure-play profit-maximizing (obviously) blockchain mining company. It has come across both the ASIC-friendly blockchain and the ASIC-Resistance blockchain. The company DOES NOT SPECULATE IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND SELLS ALL MINED CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR PROFIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All mined coins are sold for fiat profit. This is similar to Ethereum swap trade front-runners (bots) which are coded to sell all coins to profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELL&amp;rsquo;s mining corporation is a profit-seeking cryptocurrency mining corporation that seeks to maximize profits. It has a positive hurdle rate and will not invest for zero net present value (unfortunately my corporate finance notes are still in Word and Excel files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now mining powR is less preferable to mining powF, but there are three factors that favour powR to powF. There&amp;rsquo;s two factors that make powF less enticing, but one of them assumes that R&amp;amp;D would need to be done to create ASICs (which in that case, the blockchain is very insecure). The second factor would be that the ASIC vendors have profit margins, but that is an argument to showcase that requiring ASICs is a waste of money on top of providing less security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;powf-is-more-profitable-than-powr-and-has-positive-profitability&#34; &gt;powF is more profitable than powR and has Positive Profitability
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#powf-is-more-profitable-than-powr-and-has-positive-profitability&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the assumption is really that mining powF has a positive net present value. We already established that powF is more profitable to mine than powR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for powF to have a positive and higher net present value compared to powR? The profit-seeking entity will compare projected cashflows from a mining operation (assuming selling to fiat) for both blockchains, and then use a discount rate to figure out the present value of future cashflows. The discount rates &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; differ due the inherent risk of buying ASICs to mine a coin that isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to have the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure-play companies are going to invest in ASICs and mine powF, however the hurdle rate used is higher than powR&amp;rsquo;s. The hurdle rates will never be the same because there is inherent risk in investing in ASICs versus generic hardware. In cases like a mining company, if the only barrier is capital, then the barrier to entry is very low, and its possible that gross profits can become negative due to competitors obtaining lower operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually even higher for ASIC-minded coins because some ASIC vendors are going to have perverse incentives to gate-keep the best ASIC to themselves, and only releasing better ASICs once the other vendors do. AMD and Intel have no incentive to do this with generic hardware, due to the pure-play nature and how multipurpose nature of their hardware, but the ASIC company is very well versed with the blockchain they designed their ASIC for. There is no incentive to even release the first ASIC of the powF coin unless ,,mining profitability is lower than ASIC profit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gross profits are negative, that means revenue from mining is less than the cost to run the hardware. In the case of the generic hardware, once gross-profit is negative, they will switch to general compute, however for the ASICs, the business will simply stop mining. This means that the bankruptcy risk is higher with ASIC mining companies. When the bankruptcy risk is higher, so to will the required rate of return of the company&amp;rsquo;s investors and as such a higher hurdle rate is required from powF. All this proves is that  powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority to powR depends entirely on price. In practice, you could argue that an ASIC-friendly coin is more secure than ASIC-resistance coins just solely based on the market cap difference, but this is true even between two ASIC-friendly coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security of a blockchain should not assume that the net present value will always be highest for mining blockchain compared to other areas, especially from the bigger picture that each of these mining companies could be publicly traded. If the profitability is lower for blockchain companies, less capital will be provided as more companies provide the financial picture. Bitcoin mining companies are great examples of this, and showcases how valuation is entirely dictated by the speculative nature of the operation. In other words, mining can be unprofitable, and in these cases speculative investors are driving security under their assumption that the price will go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculative-investors&#34; &gt;Speculative Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#speculative-investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculative entities mine coins based on speculation that that the coins will appreciate in value. These firms do not care about operational profit, and thus its rationale that they will allocate the same amount of money to each blockchain they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason to ignore what speculative investors do is because they flee the moment the market hits the top. Tullip mania, Canada&amp;rsquo;s condo market. Speculative investors invest not because of fundamentals, but because of a speculation that the price will keep going up. If speculators are the only reason the price goes up, then at some point, when speculation or authentic demand dries up, speculators flee. There are two scenarios really, one is where powF and powR are both going down in price. In this case there is no speculator demand and security is still better for powR. In the scenario where powF&amp;rsquo;s price is going up faster than powR (which could be slowly going down), the price would have to make powF profitable, and at some point, the selling by profit-seeking entities will stop the price from going up further. But of course, block rewards get cut! But then less profit-seeking entities contribute to the security. The price would have to go up faster than the block rewards get cut for profit-seeking entities to increase security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority depends on 1) significant botnet that finds mining powR to be the most profitable (implies that powR has economic value) 2) speculators pushing price of powF at a faster growth rate than powR (for life). This last point is very disturbing. In so many cases, speculation has resulted in devastation. A great example is Canada Condo market. Speculation that leveraged condo purchases would outperform the stock market kept pushing the price of condos and pre-construction condos higher where new builds of condos were reaching peak levels. As soon as the authentic demand was softened, the speculators left, and now housing starts in Ontario have collapsed to great financial recession levels! If this happens to powF, then the miners go bankrupt, since their ASICs (balance sheet assets) would plummet in value at the same time that profitability goes down. At least in the case of general compute, there is a bottom to the asset price, but with ASICs and a speculative sell-off, things would look seriously bad.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other non-security argument for why ASIC-resistance proof-of-work is better than ASIC-friendly proof-of-work is one rooted in decentralized and fairness. The purpose is that the blockchain wants to prevent any entity from having a superior dollar invested to hashrate ratio than the common man. Rather than be super ASIC-friendly, Monero went with being super anti-ASIC, which has the additional benefit of not requiring specialized hardware to get started with mining Monero in a competitive environment. Each miner is incentivized to invest in the most efficient general purpose CPUs and to lower their operational costs rather than the alternative which is buying some other hardware which requires the former having economical value to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Proof of Work algorithm prevents specialized mining hardware from dominating the network and allows for fair distribution of block rewards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, Monero 0.15 was released with a permanent proof-of-work algorithm, RandomX, which was designed to run most effectively on general CPUs. Before, this Monero would tweak its proof-of-work algorithm often to ensure ASICs would not be mining Monero. One could argue that Monero lost security every time they did this, however these ASIC miners only existed due to having a competitive advantage compared to the 20% of non-ASIC miners. When the algorithm is no longer ASIC-friendly, it allows more players to mine Monero for profit and thus increases decentralization and network security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Conclusion, the idea that ASIC-friendliness is a superior security model to ASIC-resistance, is complete fantasy, based on an incomplete picture of how profit-seeking individuals in the real world functions. When the security of a blockchain depends on its price and thus profitability to mine, it diminished the fundamental purpose of the blockchain!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RANT: Bike Share Toronto Sucks!</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bike-share-toronto-sucks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 12:05:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bike-share-toronto-sucks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in Toronto on the date of publishing and needed to go to a bar on college st but way east of the subway station.
The problem with the street cars in Toronto during winter is that they were stalled (street parked cars were blocking them)! So I decided to walk and halfway there, I decided I should be &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; and rent a bike. Bad idea, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t my time and my hands got cold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most egregious issue with bike share toronto is that the app did not accept my payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a full list of my issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three different debit/credit cards of mine did not work. I tried Wise, WealthSimple, which I will admit are Debits, however even  the NeoFinancial Credit Card did not work! I&amp;rsquo;ll have to add my BMO Business credit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The QR codes are letters and not links.This is a bad implementation because if the QR code was a URL, the app would still be able to parse it and users without the app could be redirected to install the app! Someone who does not know English might not understand how to get a bike. Therefore, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just an incompetent implementation, there is also an accessibility issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app asks for too much private information. For example my email, phone, and a password! Should be a simple OTP via email/phone, or none at all. Is the data of people who use these bikes being harvested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that to pay you need to manually enter the card information, it&amp;rsquo;s stupid the app doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept Google Pay or PayPal. Lyft allows us to use PayPal. Why not something as simple as a bike rental app? I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Monero improves their integration UX. Imagine being able to rent a bike anonymously! That&amp;rsquo;s the future I dream of!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this section, I will list both the ideal way and the easier ways to accept Monero. I will rank the items based on open-source (and thus self-hosted) and the ability to accept only monero. The ease of deployment will be used as a tie-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security notes: (a) a good monero gateway must handle timelocks. (b) As a bonus, instructions should prevent unauthorized access to the password file that will be passed to &lt;code&gt;monero-wallet-rpc&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s overkill, but if someone stole your ssh private key, you would want them to need your server&amp;rsquo;s user password too in order to read the file, whereas you don&amp;rsquo;t want to force the &lt;code&gt;monero-wallet-rpc&lt;/code&gt; program to require a password. (c) it would be good to provide some form of auto-update mechanism whenever Monero updates to reduce downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/moneropay/moneropay&#34;&gt;MoneroPay&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro: never had a time-lock bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro: similar to Stripe&amp;rsquo;s API (REST + webhook architecture)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Con: Does not forward mempool detections (I will try to contribute this myself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Con: deployment instructions are not service based (manual only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sethforprivacy.com/guides/accepting-monero-via-btcpay-server/&#34;&gt;BtcPay&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest pain point of BtcPay is that all these tutorials force you to accept Bitcoin, which is definitely not what I&amp;rsquo;m about. Bitcoin has significant privacy issues making it very unattractive to me from the beginning of my Crypto experience. I definitely dislike that the tutorials, including this one by Seth, force you to accept Bitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. The other thing, is that you are forced to use the &amp;ldquo;BTCPAY&amp;rdquo; branding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bitpay.com/business/&#34;&gt;bitpay&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nowpayments.io/&#34;&gt;NOWPayments&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only reason I put it below bitpay is because it confuses first time crypto-currency users. If you want to send 4 XMR, the receiver gets 4 XMR, however the sender pays a network fee. Therefore, you spend more than 4 XMR, and the receiver receives exactly 4 XMR. Only in the case where there are not enough funds is it possible for the receiver to receive less than 4 XMR. NOWPayments fear mongers saying that you have to send enough to cover the fees. This confuses users because now users may believe they need to send more than 4 XMR and that the fee is taken from the amount being sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof of Concepts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/monero-payment-processing/&#34;&gt;Custom Python Implementation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concise code to adapt to any language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untested support for mempool (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, it&amp;rsquo;s the fault of  monero-wallet-rpc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No timelock bug (my code always considered the possibility of rogue actors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live on &lt;a href=&#34;https://lenerva.com/store/&#34;&gt;lenerva.com/store&lt;/a&gt;. The reason I put it in proof-of-concept is because I bundle the processing code with my backend, thereby making this a stingy solution. There&amp;rsquo;s also no monero-wallet-rpc update mechanism and it&amp;rsquo;s not dockerized. monero-pay was implemented thinking of the bigger picture, whereas I was thinking of tailoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CryptoGrampy/HotShop&#34;&gt;HotShop by CryptoGrampy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small business types of shops that don&amp;rsquo;t have an integrated inventory-POS software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsure if timelock issue is taken care of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsure if mempool is seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/busyboredom/acceptxmr/&#34;&gt;AcceptXMR&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;that uses CMS or ecommerce plugins: WordPress, Shopify, WooCommerce, Clover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shopify: TODO, however it&amp;rsquo;s just BtcPay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPress without WooCommerce: TODO, however it&amp;rsquo;s also BtcPay&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section will be on how to integrate Monero processing in stores that already use a POS system such as Square and Clover. This section is empty because apparently only I care to think of closing this gap in terms of usability. The work for Clover would involve Android development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible Playbooks
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will make my own since these are unmaintained and require a lot of maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you just need &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lalanza808/docker-monero-node?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-monero-node&#34;&gt;docker-monero-node&lt;/a&gt; and every time you get notified that Monero has updated, you can just run the same ansible playbook with a password and without changing anything. A password will be required to inject ENV variables.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Monero Onboarding for Windows Developers</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/monero-devs-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a straightforward guide to start developing on the monero project (monero, monero-gui, etc.) on Windows without using a Linux [virtual] machine.
Although I have a Linux machine, I am maximally productive on Windows as it is my primary OS.
When copy pasting terminal commands, paste into notepad before pasting into your terminal because it&amp;rsquo;s a good habit to catch a clipboard jacking attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34; &gt;Prerequisites
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#prerequisites&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msys2.org/#installation&#34;&gt;MSYS2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Get-FileHash -Path .\INSTALLER -Algorithm SHA256&lt;/code&gt; and compare the hashes to verify the installer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/download&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/downloads&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: &lt;a href=&#34;https://desktop.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install these simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forking-a-monero-repository&#34; &gt;Forking a Monero Repository
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#forking-a-monero-repository&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute through a GitHub account,
you will need to fork the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/monero-project/monero&#34;&gt;monero&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui&#34;&gt;monero-gui&lt;/a&gt; repository.
If you are new to GitHub, see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository&#34;&gt;fork a repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in contributing without a GitHub account, you can skip this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloning-the-repository&#34; &gt;Cloning the Repository
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cloning-the-repository&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use git or GitHub Desktop to clone your fork. Clone the original repository if you want to contribute anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace the URL below with the URL of your fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--recursive&lt;/code&gt; is used so that submodules are cloned as well. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;d have to update those submodules when the build fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-vscode&#34; &gt;Setting Up VSCode
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-up-vscode&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use VS Code when working on the &lt;code&gt;monero-gui&lt;/code&gt; project and for most projects, even this blog!
The exceptions being: Python, Windows C++ development, .NET development, Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;monero-gui&lt;/code&gt; directory in VSCode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack&#34;&gt;C++ Extension Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.better-cpp-syntax&#34;&gt;Better C++ Syntax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add MSYS2 64-bit as a terminal profile in user &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#999;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;// if this setting already exists, add the MSYS2 portion
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#999;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;//     rather than overwriting any existing profiles
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#999;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;terminal.integrated.profiles.windows&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;MSYS2&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;path&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;args&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;--login&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;-i&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;env&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;MSYSTEM&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;MINGW64&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;                &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;CHERE_INVOKING&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add workspace settings as seen in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.dev/elibroftw/monero-gui/tree/vs-code-ide-settings/.vscode&#34;&gt;monero-gui fork&lt;/a&gt; (copy the .vscode folder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will most likely only need to change the &amp;ldquo;release-win64&amp;rdquo; in &lt;code&gt;tasks.json&lt;/code&gt; if you are working on monero and not monero-gui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hope to merge these settings into upstream so that everyone debugging on their machines will have an easy time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set MSYS2 as the default terminal profile for Windows in the VSCode &lt;code&gt;workspace&lt;/code&gt; settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/vs-code/setting-default-profile.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Setting default terminal profile&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open an MSYS2 Terminal in VS Code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a custom keyboard shortcut &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + T&lt;/code&gt; for toggling the terminal and &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + T&lt;/code&gt; to create a new default profile terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the terminal you opened is MSYS2 (bash) and not CMD or PS (there will be a $ sign if you indeed opened MSYS2 64bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-msys2-64-bit-dependencies&#34; &gt;Installing MSYS2 64-bit Dependencies
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#installing-msys2-64-bit-dependencies&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Windows instructions for the Monero project you are interested in, you may see that &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt; is used to install dependencies. Pacman is the default package manager on &lt;em&gt;Arch btw&lt;/em&gt;.
However, the installing process is not guaranteed to work for &lt;code&gt;monero-gui&lt;/code&gt; since the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; is missing the &lt;code&gt;-Syu&lt;/code&gt; command. If you already have MSYS2 installed like I had, you&amp;rsquo;d run into issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands in an MSYS2 64-bit bash window. I suggest using the one we opened up in the previous step or you can open one externally if you don&amp;rsquo;t use VSCode.
Note that the dependencies take a bit of storage. I think I used a couple GBs (my perspective is that I have 4+ drives). I&amp;rsquo;ve included &lt;code&gt;--noconfirm&lt;/code&gt; so that you can play Pacman on Google while these commands are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pacman -Syu --noconfirm  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#999;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# upgrade existing database and packages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#999;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# the terminal may close automatically&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Monero dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi mingw-w64-x86_64-protobuf-c mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb mingw-w64-x86_64-libgcrypt mingw-w64-x86_64-unbound mingw-w64-x86_64-doxygen mingw-w64-x86_64-libunwind mingw-w64-x86_64-ccache mingw-w64-x86_64-pcre --noconfirm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this far into the future, ensure that the list of dependencies installed is a merger of the ones I have listed and the ones listed in the project&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;
When I was writing this article, build failures were common for 3+ hours due to missing packages, an unsupported &lt;code&gt;debug-static-win64&lt;/code&gt; build target, and ccache working suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Qt5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 --noconfirm
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed that when building, Windows anti-virus would spike. So I recommend excluding the project folder as well as the msys2 folder from Windows Security or whatever anti-virus software you are running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to avoid entering in &lt;code&gt;-jN&lt;/code&gt; every time we build, but what should N be? I use CPU cores - 1 so that
I can still use my browser and other apps while building. You can run the following to set that so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#24909d&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;alias make=\&amp;#34;/usr/bin/make -j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;$((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;nproc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#3677a9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; ? &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;$((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;nproc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#3677a9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style=&#34;color:#3677a9&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ed9d13&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.profile

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;building&#34; &gt;Building
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#building&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionally enable console mode for GUI projects by commenting out &lt;code&gt;set(EXECUTABLE_FLAG WIN32)&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;src/CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt; (thanks @selsta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;build/release/bin/monero-wallet-gui.exe&lt;/code&gt; in the VSCode terminal after a build (next step)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the build command (5 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;monero-gui&lt;/code&gt;, you can either use the VSCode debugger (workspace settings) or run &lt;code&gt;make release-win64&lt;/code&gt;. The debug builds weren&amp;rsquo;t working for  me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;code&gt;monero&lt;/code&gt;, same as above but try using &lt;code&gt;debug-static-win64&lt;/code&gt; instead (need to edit &lt;code&gt;.vscode/tasks.json[0] &amp;gt; windows &amp;gt; args[0]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the debug build failed, you might need to &lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt; for the release build to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting failures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build failed because of missing library
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build release after a make clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-name&lt;/code&gt; (where name is the libname with and without lib)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for the library (with and without the lib prefix) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://packages.msys2.org/search&#34;&gt;packages.msys2.org&lt;/a&gt;. Click on relevant search results and install the binary package starting with &lt;code&gt;mingw-w64-x86_64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt; before building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runtime error from Qt failing to load plugin?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uninstall all qt packages using &lt;code&gt;pacman -R $(pacman -Qq | grep qt)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install qt using &lt;code&gt;pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 --noconfirm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;code&gt;monero-gui&lt;/code&gt; full build, use &lt;code&gt;cd build/release &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make deploy&lt;/code&gt; after running &lt;code&gt;make release-win64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the build fails due to DLL copy error, follow the troubleshooting instructions in step 4 and let me know what worked so that I can update this article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute anonymously, I suggest you git commit on a separate branch than the default one.
After you&amp;rsquo;ve committed your changes, run the following from your branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git format-patch master --stdout &amp;gt; ~/Downloads/PATCH_NAME.patch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;ve assumed that the default branch is master, but it is entirely possible when working on other projects where the default branch is not master. Default branch names I&amp;rsquo;ve seen are &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve created a patch, you can post it on #monero-dev or #monero-gui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.to/#/#monero-dev:monero.social&#34;&gt;monero-dev matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.to/#/#monero-gui:monero.social&#34;&gt;monero-gui matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;irc://irc.libera.chat/#monero-dev&#34;&gt;monero-dev IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;irc://irc.libera.chat/#monero-gui&#34;&gt;monero-gui IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing. My house has these Plume devices which blocks matrix.to links, so I&amp;rsquo;m running a VPN a lot of the time now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will assume you can figure out yourself how to commit your code changes and push them to your GitHub fork.
However, I will provide some git commands to use for common occurrences. I am not a git guru so I use GitHub Desktop + VS Code most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph&#34;&gt;Git Graph&lt;/a&gt; extension to avoid the CLI for rebasing, squashing commits, and other actions
where GitHub Desktop is inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are developing a feature and now your forked repo is many commits behind the upstream target branch. Or your pull request cannot be merged due to at least one conflict (a conflict arises when git cannot determine whose change should be respected because there are exclusive commits in two different branches that changed the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: rebase. A rebase is when you sandwich exclusive commits from another branch between the shared commits within your branch and your exclusive commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure you are on the branch with your commits. Use &lt;code&gt;git checkout branchName&lt;/code&gt; if you aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add upstream ORIGINAL_REPO_LINK&lt;/code&gt; (CLI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase upstream/master&lt;/code&gt; (CLI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve conflicts (IDE like VSCode or CLI editor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit and force push (UI or CLI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did not fork the repo, life is a bit easier as you can skip step 2 and use the command &lt;code&gt;git rebase master&lt;/code&gt; for step 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you went on a commit rampage just for one feature. Everything works, so one commit is more elegant than many commits.
To perform a squash, reset your branch to the commit you don&amp;rsquo;t want to squash. Commit your changes and force push. Make sure
the commit you are resetting to is on the same branch. Otherwise you are performing a rebase and might need to resolve a merge conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create a Monero Payment Processor</title>

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#preface&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend spinning up monero-pay on a server, although support for mempool webhooks is a missing feature. In January 2022, I created my very own &lt;a href=&#34;https://lenerva.com/store/&#34;&gt;ecommerce store&lt;/a&gt; with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript-free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero acceptance via my custom processor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit-Card acceptance via Stripe Sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop-shipping integrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a design document than a copy-paste solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end I mention an alternative, more long-term solution than the short-term kinda complicated cost-effective solution I made.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an MVP, you need to set environment variables for each backend server, such that each server has a corresponding ACCOUNT number for your Monero wallet. Each of these servers will have the same view-wallet opened through monero-wallet-rpc. &lt;a href=&#34;#logistics&#34;&gt;Logistics for backend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your backend, when a user creates an order and selects Monero as the payment method, you should send an API request the monero-wallet-rpc that is running. Here is a snippet of my code. The relevant portion is the request as well as the error checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great, so users can now create an order with monero as the payment method. But how do they pay? When the order is created, in contrast to Stripe&amp;rsquo;s Session, you can redirect the user to the order page and show them a QR code of &lt;code&gt;xmr_qr_data&lt;/code&gt;. You will need to create the qr code yourself. If you use Python, install pyqrcode and pypng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving on to processing. This processing function is on a different thread/process. I used multiprocessing in Python to ensure that whenever the backend starts up, this function gets called. Modify to fit your needs. Important things in this function are: double spend protection, &amp;gt; 1 confirmations required, 1 cent tolerance, sums all payments to an address instead of just one. When the order is marked as paid, your order processing task/service can take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the RPC-wallet is running, you can add a &amp;ldquo;start if not already running&amp;rdquo; function to your backend. I&amp;rsquo;ll share the code I use myself in the future, but these are the arguments for running your RPC. For development, ask the user to enter the wallet password since that wallet would most likely be spendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;configs/monero-rpc.common.conf&lt;/code&gt; to contain the base configuaration of the RPC. Other parameters are based upon whether we are running the website in devevelopment or production.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each account index actually corresponds to the view wallet history on each server. If those wallets ever get replaced, the servers need to be assigned new account numbers. You can avoid this pitfall by adding a database check to see if the address was in use, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that for performance reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s better to have a table in your database for
determining which account index was last assigned t a server, and then use a script that increase this number whenever a view-wallet needs to be transferred onto a server. This way, you avoid having to remember the pitfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;monero-wallet-rpc&lt;/code&gt; would need to be manually updated, but since the scanning largely depends on the daemon, which I have an update script for, this issue is not as severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get back to prioritizing the ecommerce store, I will a) add more items to sell b) automation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, my method is complicated, but it does save me $5/month. If I was a manager at Google, I&amp;rsquo;d do it the following way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a payment processor API that can horizontally scale. Instead of assigning an account number to each app server, only assign it to API servers. There should be at least one API server per data centre region in use (DigitalOcean reference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API would encapsulate the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create_invoice(amount, expiry=3600, currency=&amp;lsquo;XMR&amp;rsquo;, qrCode=false)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;returns an address, the payment URI, and optionally the png data for the QR code, possibly even an invoice id (positive number).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check_invoice(address=None, invoice_id=None)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;returns amount_in_mempool, amount_received (1 to X confirmations), amount_confirmed (X confirmations), and paid which is a boolean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a user registers for the API, they can either provide a view-wallet, or a wallet is created for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if no view-wallet is provided, there should be functionality to transfer upon payments, through a UI, or through a more restrictive API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-custodian processing service does not exist as far as I know, so I might create one and charge a monthly $5 fee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows using the same architecture across a multitude of apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good for enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decouples processing from application code&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike my last article about why Monero is the best crypto as a currency because of its privacy vs. layer 2 solutions, this article is a deep dive on why I continue to choose Monero and not its privacy-related competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cultural noticeable difference in culture and attitude amongst Monero and other coins. In r/monero, there is always a discussion going on.
In these other privacy coin subreddits however, there is so many posts about price and going to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I value quality, so if I make any argumentative mistakes in the article, I will correct them if I am notified.
I have multiple reasons, so if one or two are technically incorrect, my argument will hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero is the FIRST privacy coin that was NOT PRE-MINED.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero is the &lt;strong&gt;most used&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt; crypto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero is actively improved/developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero Changes for the Better
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fork of ByteCoin without the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=740112&#34;&gt;premine and shadyness&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero innovated beyond ByteCoin with: RandomX ASIC-resistance, Ring-CT, Bulletproofs(+)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RandomX mining algorithm does not require modifications via hard forks to maintain its ASIC-resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero is superior today than Monero 5 years ago, and Monero in 5 years will be superior to Monero today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic swaps (infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero&amp;rsquo;s researchers actively create / think of attacks on Monero&amp;rsquo;s privacy so that the protocol can be improved to defend against these attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship free, there is even a post called Skepticism Sunday on r/monero! Even my unpopular post critiquing UX was approved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with comparing ZCash since it is propped up as being the runner up to Monero. By comparing Monero to ZCash,
all other coins should make a case that they are better than ZCash before trying to spread Monero FUD. That is why I put in more effort in the ZCash section
than the other coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only fair that the lesser known and used privacy cryptocurrencies figure out who the runner up to Monero is.
Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;ll be impossible for any one person to perform an unbiased comparison of them all to Monero in the future when thousands of people think
claim to be the next Satoshi. This is already the case with arguably subjective things like religion/faith/belief. There are thousands of religions, it is simply unfeasible to conduct a thorough unbiased review of all religions including the less known ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t use trusted setup as an argument for this section, even though as of 2022-2-26, the Halo Arc update that was supposed to remove trusted setup is 28+ days overdue.
What is unavailable is the technical aspects of how the trusted setup will be removed or what replaces it to ensure privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zk-snarks is an unproven technology simply asserted as secure. The assumptions are relatively new compared to the decades old and reliable elliptic curve cryptography used by Monero.
It&amp;rsquo;d be like saying RSA is secure because we don&amp;rsquo;t know if products can be back calculated with ease.
We &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; know that products can&amp;rsquo;t be back calculated with ease, and we also know that Quantum computers are a threat. This is called a strong guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ZCash is built on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1016429267175989248&#34;&gt;unproven technology&lt;/a&gt; (accessed 2022-12-4), it could have a fatal flaw and is thus one giant experiment. Therefore, if you want digital cash, you can either be a real life guinea pig by using ZCash or use Monero which is based on battle-test technology. One who uses cryptocurrencies is already making a speculation that decentralized money is the future. By trusting ZCash, one is making a second speculation which is that no flaws will be found in ZK-SNARK for two more decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-privacy-coin-without-privacy-users&#34; &gt;A Privacy Coin without Privacy Users
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-privacy-coin-without-privacy-users&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This applies to every coin below since they all have less users than Monero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best privacy would be the best at being untraceable and at protecting users&amp;rsquo; holdings and their multiple identities.
In 2020, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/593.pdf&#34;&gt;team of researchers (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; concluded that 99.9% of ZCash transactions are traceable.
In the abstract, researchers say &amp;ldquo;strict security and anonymity requirements, … makes the coin effectively untraceable, as shown by &lt;em&gt;Monero&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Optional privacy is junk. If you decide to use shielded transactions on ZCash, you&amp;rsquo;ve made a target of yourself since your transactions stick out like a sore thumb! You don&amp;rsquo;t have privacy if you are the only user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ZCash users don&amp;rsquo;t use shielded addresses and even the miners don&amp;rsquo;t follow the advice of Electric Coin Company to use shielded addresses.
Mining pools get to decide whether miners get to use shielded addresses. Another case of optional privacy simply not working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions/537a4edc34ea030216ef0c04e0a977e5efeda53aa497c41560c4ac658a5f5192&#34;&gt;Transparent to shielded transactions&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t even hide the amount sent to a shielded address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence of this is that users have to consciously remember to use different transparent addresses for people/entities who refuse
to send ZEC to shielded addresses. What a nuisance! It&amp;rsquo;d be like being in relationships with many women and keeping track of a schedule so that they don&amp;rsquo;t know of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the technical arguments against ZCash. Onwards, I have the more UX and developer based arguments compared to Monero. I also touch on the fact
that there is a 10% dev tax on the total ZCash supply. This is no different than paying government officials just to use cash (the government has a bigger job than just managing its currency).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the picture below, how would the user know if they are sending from a shielded address? They don&amp;rsquo;t know! This hurts the privayc of ZEC users. It hinders privacy without even improving UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/crypto/zcash-wallet-1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ZCash Wallet 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each address is it&amp;rsquo;s own account, and so no sub-addresses are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/crypto/zcash-wallet-2.webp&#34; alt=&#34;ZCash Wallet 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to Monero. Each account has infinitely generated subaddresses and the balance is shown on an account basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/crypto/monero-wallet-1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monero Wallet 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zecwallet Lite also does not store the wallet encrypted.
I was never asked to create a pass code to decrypt the wallet so anyone who uses ZCash on a computer can have their ZCash stolen if their laptop/computer/storage is accessed by a third party.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but privacy goes hand in hand with (operating and informational) security. There even is a wallet encryption option, but just like privacy, security is off by default!
To think that these people sponsor Edward Snowden who has the spine to go against the USA but has no spine to scrutinize this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sending Monero, users do not have to think about if they are sending from the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; account since each account&amp;rsquo;s primary address shows up as a stealth address in the Ring-CT in the block of the blockchain.
Recipients can&amp;rsquo;t make judgments about your level of care to privacy if you decide to donate with a primary account or other account.
Unlike ZCash, where the recipient will know whether you made a shielded transaction or not, and then make you a target (assuming an all Monero ecosystem or an all ZCash ecosystem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZCash users say ZCash is better because it uses zk-snarks to avoid large transactions sizes. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens when we combine this with optional privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also no wallet for Stagenet/testnet, so testing ZCash will be a problem.
Here is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/testnet_guide.html&#34;&gt;ZCash testnet&lt;/a&gt; in case someone or even myself in the future wants to find
more practical issues with ZCash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to test out ZCash transactions, but ran into major troubles.
First of all, the ZCash GUI wallets don&amp;rsquo;t support testnet.
Secondly, the CLI does not support for on Windows.
Thirdly, because I have WSL, their &lt;code&gt;zcash-cli&lt;/code&gt; says it requires a &lt;code&gt;zcash.conf&lt;/code&gt; even though the file exists in same directory as the binary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to test out ZCash because to confirm that creating sheilded transactions are incredibly slow.
There are no demos online showing the time it takes to generate a simple shielded transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Monero, below is a video I made demoing a Monero transaction with one receiving address.
The relevant portions took only 10 seconds! Most of the time was spent entering an address, an amount,
entering my password, moving the GUI, and me talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching online for Zcash demos yields some guy using two webapps and a CLI to send ZEC to many receivers.
He cut the waiting process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, ZCash is basically a publicly traded company, except the owners of ZEC have no power
over the owners of the Codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a developer tax of 10% on the total capped supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single company owns 10% of the total money of the world, yet ZCash founders think it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable or they think ZCash isn&amp;rsquo;t a global currency.
Users have to pay a tax to keep ZCash in development?
Where&amp;rsquo;s the Linux tax then to use Linux? Linus Torvald should be the richest man alive if this was an ethical thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, ZEC does not use an ASIC resistant PoW algorithm and will become PoS in the future as indicated by its CEO!
Yes, ZEC is a product of centralization, not decentralization. It&amp;rsquo;s CEO had drunkenly admitted to being against privacy for all (criminals here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how ZCash pays Edward Snowden, a criminal to the USA, to support ZCash, which would turn around and oust him if he used it in the US.
ZCash&amp;rsquo;s philosophy is &amp;ldquo;if a state doesn&amp;rsquo;t like you, we don&amp;rsquo;t like you, unless you are an influencer.&amp;rdquo; I had no idea that it&amp;rsquo;s even possible to be a double hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it can be done is a question but before you think of banning criminals from having privacy, first think about how that&amp;rsquo;s even possible.
And then think about if you would&amp;rsquo;ve been a criminal if you had just been living in a different country, such as an authoritarian one.
Venezuela, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, not that any of these are extreme authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution to the narrow problem below is random amounts of churning, at least until Seraphis comes and increases the ring signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zooko believes Monero&amp;rsquo;s privacy obfuscation does not work because of the poisoned outputs attack.
In essence, bad actor A sends to an anonymous address owned by person B, and person B sends monero with this stealth address in the ring signature to bad actor C without anonymity.
If this occurs at least 2 times or with another bad actor, then the bad actors can derive the identity of the anonymous person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, this attack is not full proof because users can send Monero to themselves (churning).
Each churn would increase the distance between the bad actors, and increases the anonymity set.
At a certain point, which requires more research to determine, there would be significant doubt
whether the stealth address included 5 transactions deep is the same user as the one sending the monero.
And if the stealth address is included in someone elses transaction to the bad actor, consider all
accusations void!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumptions that Zooko makes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User does not churn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users are sending Monero without anonymity to bad actors
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;selling of XMR for fiat one exchanges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying goods and services from businesses who don&amp;rsquo;t respect user privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User is being targeted by state actors, which Zooko says he supports in his drunken tweets as I mentioned previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to privacy, how privacy tools are used greatly affects the privacy achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PoS (read as proof of stake not piece of shit) fork of Monero, so it&amp;rsquo;s not good for money. However they are trying to innovate in terms of DApps unlike other projects listed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/why-monero-is-the-best-crypto-currency/#consensus-algorithm&#34;&gt;PoW vs. PoS vs. DPoS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a PoS (read as both proof of stake and piece of shit). Secret Network has not demonstrated that they are private at all. &lt;a href=&#34;https://explorer.secret.dev/tx/0x250f41c1b7988a57ad79503d412c99e1dfba04edb110b0237b7e9e2c31d03645/internal-transactions&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a random transaction I found on their blockchain explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the sender address, the receiver address, the value of the transaction, the balances of both the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://explorer.secret.dev/address/0xF070515d7a05ED5f7b2C50106F615E8275e1b9D2/transactions&#34;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://explorer.secret.dev/address/0x53d77827bE168aB2a911B5A14D0f16D1C5657196/transactions&#34;&gt;sender&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension transaction history as well.
I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before and I&amp;rsquo;ll say it again; Transparent transactions on the blockchain hurt the privacy of all users. In Monero, there are view keys to allow for transactions to be shared without the blockchain showing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secret Network claims to be private, but the blockchain explorer says otherwise. I have more bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s open their &lt;a href=&#34;https://scrt.network/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. It looks nice, I&amp;rsquo;ll give them that. However, suppose I&amp;rsquo;m interested in owning SCRT. I go to the page with the wallets and Keplr doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Firefox, neither does Cosmostation, and the second option requires signing up! Privacy but you need to use Chrome? Privacy is interlinked with freedom. You simply can&amp;rsquo;t have one without the other and claim supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare minimum for any crypto project is a working desktop GUI wallet that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require additional dependencies. I thought Monero&amp;rsquo;s GUI lacks some UX, but amongst the competition, it ranks at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bogatyy/grin-linkability#faq&#34;&gt;96% of Grin transactions were linked&lt;/a&gt; because MimbleWimble is flawed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like the Lightning Network, users need to actively exchange data in order to receive. Want to receive donations? You&amp;rsquo;ll need to use a website to facilitate the transaction. They did this in the name of scale. But this is a huge downside. Scale is not an issue in Monero, and if it does become an issue, then we can talk about solutions. YouTube itself has managed to stay stable and it stores Petabytes of information. Scale is a relative term and until Monero is over 1TB in size, scale is a non-problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since it is mimblewimble by default, it is just the successor to Litecoin, and not anything special. If mimblewimble was that good, even Litecoin would be considered as private. In terms of the privacy hierarchy, Grin is at the same level of ZCash, maybe a bit worse since no&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something like Beam competes with Grin. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve given up having to do the homework of people for them.
Monero is #1. The burden of proof is on all other cryptos to prove they are better than Grin, ZCash, and Secret Network.
If they can&amp;rsquo;t or don&amp;rsquo;t do that, users shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even pay these projects a piece of mind. Refer to the introduction of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;No stealth addresses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you give out is what gets put into the chain, this is bad when combined with the next point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction Data is visible

&lt;li&gt;A project that forces users to donate, is no open-source project at all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid Consensus
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firo uses their own FiroPoW algorithm that is optimized for GPUs.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPUs are definitely more accessible than GPUs so coins like Firo make the cost of GPUs go up for people who buy them to game and not to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPUs are much more in abundance and anyone can start mining on their already owned devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their reasoning is to sap ETH miners and they throw shade for being anti-botnet which is not true. Botnets are the problem, not what botnets are used for!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masternodes (PoS) are used to mititgate 51% attacks.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rich get richer by using masternodes which requires $3,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are either not private at all, or not private by default.
They are definitely disingenuous to say the least in claiming that FIRO is setting privacy standards.
More like Firo is failing to meet the privacy standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is serious. You should not sweep these problems under the bed as if they don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monero has come a long way with consenting donations. No project, that aims to be the best, should force users to subsidize its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DERO cannot to be trusted at all.
They used bulletproof technology before the technology was already audited and
the PR person at the time just said &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8pnt1u/dero_creates_a_new_type_of_dag/e0cvb87/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;our devs looked at it okayed it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fork of Zcash without transparent addresses . There&amp;rsquo;s not enough information available to comment on Pirate Chain except for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PirateNetwork/pirate#build-pirate&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;This software is based on zcash and considered experimental and is continuously undergoing heavy development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - accessed 2022-12-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses the same proof of work algorithm as ZCash which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.bitmain.com/?coin=ZEC&#34;&gt;not ASIC-resistant&lt;/a&gt; - accessed 2022-12-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simply not popular enough to warrant a discussion and it should be them to argue against Monero.
Their only argument is usually zk-snarks, but trusting zk-snarks is risky because it requires trusting that the system was setup correctly.
Pirate chain used a trusted setup since it was a ZCash pre-Halo fork. In the privacy and security space, strong guarantees are required and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en/article/93b3ay/fbi-backdoor-anom-phones-gps-data&#34;&gt;not probabilities or &amp;ldquo;trust me&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to test their sketchy wallet, but it required me to download the blockchain. Yeah, no thank you. If Monero can be used without a local blockchain, then I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to download the blockchain to test a coin that does not even have a tenth of Monero&amp;rsquo;s usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://raidatech.com/&#34;&gt;RAIDA Tech&lt;/a&gt; which is supposed to be the backbone, uses HTTP instead of HTTPS!
They claim &amp;ldquo;greater privacy&amp;rdquo; but they use HTTP instead of HTTPS by default. My websites all use HTTPS by default.
It is also unclear how to independently run a node.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is a tool. and similar to religion, there are many of them.
In religion, there&amp;rsquo;s something called Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Wager. ThereminTrees has a good video on the fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough time for you to do an unbiased research on all religions to figure out
the best one. But we are presented with this same problem for cryptocurrency but &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/converging-opinions&#34;&gt;I have a solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Monero, these other privacy coins are used 1000x less. The burden of proof is on them to prove
that they are better than Grin, ZCash, and Secret Network before asking to argue against Monero.
Every redundant coin comes at the expense of collective privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unreasonable to ask Monero developers and experts to spend their time rebutting your arguments
when the cryptos both have the same goal. And if you can prove the coin to be better than Monero to me,
good luck trying to do it with Bitcoin maxis. I have an open mind; why else would I even try to use ZCash and Secret Network?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I hope for people to contribute to a single digital cash project rather than start their own.
It&amp;rsquo;s sad enough that people think the upgrades to Monero are not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to donate some Monero.

      <title>How to Buy Monero (XMR) in Canada</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 22:56:02 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-buy-monero-in-canada/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why I believe in Monero, feel free to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/why-monero-is-the-best-crypto-currency&#34;&gt;Why Monero is the Best Crypto CURRENCY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 2nd, 2024: Kraken Canada has delisted Monero. For US residents, Kraken is still the best way to buy Monero. The best methods to buy Monero in Canada are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KYC
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy USDC (0.5% spread) on Coinbase and then use &lt;a href=&#34;#coinbase-usdc--trocador-usdc--xmr&#34;&gt;Trocador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No-KYC
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://retoswap.com/&#34;&gt;Haveno Retoswap&lt;/a&gt;, look for &amp;ldquo;no deposit&amp;rdquo; trades, buy the minimum amount of XMR, and then from then on buy from deposit trades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimal-methods&#34; &gt;Optimal Methods
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#optimal-methods&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;#kraken&#34;&gt;Kraken CAD → USD → XMR method&lt;/a&gt;, you will pay at most 1% in fees. The more volume you do with Kraken, the lower the fees. Only if your wire transfer fees are very high and you want to buy $10k - 16k worth of Monero should you use the Coinbase USDC to Trocador method.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2025, this is the best method and will cost you at most 1% in total fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href=&#34;https://invite.kraken.com/JDNW/kpdi6rez&#34;&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; ($100 when you trade $200) [Code: 3zh45fpb] account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify your account (24 hours?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Kraken Pro from the 9 dots menu in the top right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit USD if you already have a USD bank account (Wise will not work) and go to step 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, deposit CAD via eTransfer (if depositing 10k CAD or less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO NOT USE THE CONVERT FEATURE TO ACQUIRE USD, THE FX RATE SHOWN IS A RIP OFF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to USD/CAD trading pair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market buy order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to XMR/USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place a limit buy order either at a price level that would fulfill your volume (0.4% fees as a taker) or place a limit buy order below market prices (0.2% fees as a maker).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, I bought 198 CAD worth of Monero on a 200 CAD deposit where I was a taker in both the USD/CAD and XMR/USD pairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2021 experience is here for historic purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total fee percentage: 1.3574%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is possibly the cheapest if you are a liquidity taker, however there is deposit limit of $3,000 per day compared to Coinbase which allows for $10,000 at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deposit fee of 0.1% for etransfers (3k limit), a USD conversion fee of 0.2%, and a 0.16% post limit order fee to buy XMR, and a flat network fee to withdraw (not counted). In total, that&amp;rsquo;s 0.46% as a maker and a 0.56% fee as a taker. You can use Etana to forgo the deposit fee, but I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if Etana has its own fees and it does require KYC. A wire transfer requires being in-persona which might have its own fees; it does for my business account!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own results for the etransfer deposit method are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAD/USD = 1.25625&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XMR/USD = 285.48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an etransfer of 3,000 CAD becomes 2,970 CAD converted to 2,359.45 USD bought 8.2648521800 XMR withdrew and received 8.25152 XMR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fee = 3,000 - 8.2648521800 * 285.48 * 1.25625 = 35.94&amp;hellip; = 1.198%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to set the limit order one cent less than market with &lt;strong&gt;post&lt;/strong&gt; selected unless you are treating it as a security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The etransfer deposit fee took the largest chunk! I&amp;rsquo;ll have to test the other methods to compare.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an experiment in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy USDC on Coinbase and send it to Kraken via the Arbitrum network. Knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s 0.5% cheaper than the Newton XLM method, we get 0.82% for makers and 1.53% for takers. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have patience to place a limit order at the market price, I recommend using FixedFloat which takes a 0.65% fees for swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xlm--usd--xmr&#34; &gt;XLM → USD → XMR

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an experiment in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total fee percentage: 1.32% - 2.03%, 1% just from Newton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought for C$0.119274 (1% margin), sold for US$0.089 (lucky), monero for $137.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying XLM on Newton costed me a margin of 1%. I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly disappointed with Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transferring XLM to Kraken was free. Selling to USD has a 0.16% fee for a post limit order, and a post limit order on XMR is another 0.16%.
So this method would result in fees of 1.32% for makers to 2.03% for takers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a hypothetical experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a USD bank account for this and you&amp;rsquo;ll need Etana which is another KYC hurdle. Theoretically this method results in
a 0.16% fee as a maker and a 0.26% fee as a taker. I say theoretically though since I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s any fee from Etana&amp;rsquo;s side and
it&amp;rsquo;s not practical as like I said before, you need to have USD beforehand without a conversion fee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First buy USDC from &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinbase.com/join/BMNW52M&#34;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; which is 0.5% in fees. Next go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://trocador.app/?ref=CGBHeJwqRb&amp;amp;ticker_from=USDC&amp;amp;network_from=Arbitrum&amp;amp;amount_from=5000&#34;&gt;Trocador&lt;/a&gt; and swap from USDC over &lt;strong&gt;Arbitrum One&lt;/strong&gt; to Monero. Trocador is a swap aggregate service, meaning that it will always use the service with the lowest swap fees. Sometimes, the swap itself has less than 0.5% in fees, meaning your total fees can be less than 1%, which is competitive with simply buying with a high reward / cashback credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a 0.5% to buy USDC on Coinbase, here are the fees for two USDC amounts. The lower the amount to trade, the lower the &lt;em&gt;slippage&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;XLM&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.473%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;ADA&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0.962% - 1.92%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.161%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread: Buy price divided by Live price minus 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: if you can&amp;rsquo;t use Coinbase to buy USDC, use ADA if you can buy at one cent less than buy price.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlYorZQTmV4?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m making this tutorial because there&amp;rsquo;s currently a bug in the GUI that won&amp;rsquo;t let
you make a stagenet wallet if you have already used a mainnet wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-to-path-environment-variable&#34; &gt;Add to PATH Environment Variable
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#add-to-path-environment-variable&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is optional but will help you in accessing the CLI in a terminal with any working directory&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ~/Documents/Monero/wallets &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mkdir stagenet_one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd stagenet_one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fungibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy Reliability (Layer 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASIC Resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store of value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not going to elaborate further than the fact that privacy invites storing wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is meant to be the definitive guide on why Monero is the king of all cryptos when it comes to fulfilling the role of money or real currency.
It is long in order to be thorough, as well as includes common responses/tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended target audience is an open-minded reader interested in cryptocurrency as well as fellow Monero users who continuously answer questions such as &amp;ldquo;why does Monero (not) do X?.&amp;rdquo;
I am open to debate, but I will say that when it comes to cryptoCURRENCY, privacy is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be comparing Monero&amp;rsquo;s features to those found in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM), and ZCash (ZEC).
I will also talk about layer 2 solutions: BTC&amp;rsquo;s Lightning, BCH&amp;rsquo;s CashFusion, ETH&amp;rsquo;s Tornado Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all other cryptos/solutions, one can use the transitive property: If Monero &amp;gt; X and X &amp;gt; Y, then Monero &amp;gt; Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start with a brief introduction to Monero, since privacy was not simple to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-monero&#34; &gt;What is Monero?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-monero&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a high levels, Monero aims to be digital cash. It actually outdoes cash when it comes to fungibility.
It does not support smart contracts, but there is some research being done on how to support some smart contract features.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero uses stealth addresses to obscure the number of times an address has received Monero. These are similar to the modulus concept where (x mod 5 = 3) has an infinite number of solutions. They are created by the sender to protect the information of the receiver. That way, an observer is uncertain how many times a targeted address has actually received Monero. All wallets implement this, so only a bad actor would not create a stealth address, but Monero doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on just stealth addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero uses ring signatures to protect the identity of the sender. At the moment, each transaction has 10 other possible signatories, called decoys, as seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://xmrchain.net/tx/75fbbd3db7d7a5739e06c61282990bb44c090ee81ff288cde1feb7ea82f67f51&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One seed is the key to an infinite amount of accounts each with an infinite amount of addresses. Think of this like having multiple chequing accounts and each has multiple direct deposit numbers. These accounts are mathematically generated, so the nth account will always be the same on different wallet clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction fees reduce as the number of transactions increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block sizes are dynamic in the long term but block-to-block growth is capped via mining penalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero uses the proof-of-work consensus protocol RandomX algorithm for its ASIC resistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monero is not a Bitcoin fork. It is actually a Bytecoin fork with several improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culpable cryptos: Most except Monero, its forks, and possibly some mimblewimble coins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a crypto to be money, it has to be fungible. If crypto is not fungible, users are at risk of being denied service for not being &amp;ldquo;right.&amp;rdquo; The definition of right would be dependent on the receiver and could even be legislated by governments. Transaction histories allow this to happen and there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee you aren&amp;rsquo;t being watched for maybe transacting with someone who had the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; coins. This is an issue with all cryptocurrencies except for Monero. With ZEC, since transactions are public by default, and most transactions on the blockchain are public, having the option for public transactions means that receivers can simply refute any transaction that isn&amp;rsquo;t public. This is true for exchanges. Exchange use t-addresses for ZEC, not the shielded ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you may say not having fungibility prevents money laundering and duly hurts criminals (does it really though?), but what about the undue harm to individuals? The definition of a criminal is different in every country. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/map-of-criminalisation/&#34;&gt;Humanity Dignity Trust&lt;/a&gt;, engaging in homosexual activities is a crime in 71 countries. We actively hurt marginalized groups when we promote non-fungible cryptos. If you and your same-sex partner shared crypto together, an authoritative government can easily suspect you of sleeping together, since sharing bank/money accounts is more common among partners than friends. If you like to argue in bad faith by saying maybe they are just father-son, you&amp;rsquo;d be lying to yourself if you think governments making homosexuality a crime is going to think half of the people sharing an account with the same-sex is just a rich parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy&#34; &gt;Privacy
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#privacy&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy is defined as protecting sensitive information such as networth, transaction value, and if a person transacted.
Culpable cryptos: All except Monero, its forks, ZCash&amp;rsquo;s shielded transactions, and possibly mimblewimble coins.
There are layer 2 solutions, but like I said before, these aren&amp;rsquo;t easy to use, and are prone to ignorance. Users would be required to know about them, they cost more,
the transactions stand out, and the user looks automatically suspicious for transacting differently than other people on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Monero, the defaults are private and deviation from the defaults erodes users&amp;rsquo; own privacy, and so it is not encouraged unless you
know what you are doing! Churning, timelocks (DO NOT TOUCH THIS), and sending to multiple addresses comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is a fundamental human right. Any cryptocurrency that doesn&amp;rsquo;t protect the balance of a wallet by protecting the history of transactions, puts the owner at risk from bad actors. One should not have to take many precautions such as using multiple wallets just for some privacy. One would also have to somehow keep each wallet&amp;rsquo;s coins separated from each other. Then there are mixers. Mixers/Tumblers are 2014 technology. They cost more transaction fees, take time, and spam the network. Objectively speaking, a cryptocurrency that can protect your privacy with one transaction is much better than a cryptocurrency that requires you to use 3rd party tools for some possible privacy. How can you be certain that proprietary blockchain analysis tools haven&amp;rsquo;t already figured out a way to map out tumbled coins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a real example of the privacy provided by the fiat banking system: In Canada, we have Interac eTransfers. When I send an eTransfer to my friend, or vice-versa, we don&amp;rsquo;t know how much each other has. But if we had used BTC, ETH, SOL, XLM, and by ZEC (default configuration for the sender), we could&amp;rsquo;ve seen each others&amp;rsquo; balances. We simply cannot expect any crypto to replace fiat if the privacy will end up being worse than using fiat. This is of course assuming a world where crypto prices have reduced volatility. Before you say &amp;ldquo;people do not care about privacy,&amp;rdquo; please tell me would you leave the door open at a public washroom? People do care about privacy, they just prefer convenience more. Monero aims to be the convenient solution that is private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dismantle some arguments that think network effect + layer n solutions &amp;gt; layer 1 privacy. I will not be using # of users as an argument when there are more Monero users than there are users using the Layer n solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tumblers&#34; &gt;Tumblers

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires users to trust centralized service or do it yourself which is tricky for new users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tumblers can be traced by blockchain analytic companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction fees ++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network spam ++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not protect balances and thus would require managing at least two addresses just to reach the basic level of Monero&amp;rsquo;s privacy. UX is much simpler and thus better for Monero. Monero has its own UX faults, but they are all UI and not technical. UI can always be improved at no cost to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires user knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News from 2024 is that Samurai and Wasabi both disabled their custom &amp;ldquo;privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inbound liquidity. You need 5 BTC to receive ≤ 5 BTC. This is a rich get the richer scheme, and it&amp;rsquo;s not mentioned often enough.
Many people around the world live paycheck to paycheck, people simply cannot be paid in BTC-Lightning because of this incredible flaw. Remember we are dicussing cryptocurrency as money.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The propose solution to this is to pay someone 1% of the liquidity you need every time you want to receive too much BTC. So imagine losing 1% every time you want to receive BTC and liquidate (spend).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboarding issues (L1 Transaction)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees: opening a channel requires you to tie up BTC into a channel and costs you a transaction fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited Transactions/day: There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough time in the world to onboard billions of people who require money to transact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance attack. An attacker can send fake transactions to your invoice to determine your channel balance. You may argue you can have multiple channels or you can store most BTC on layer 1, but how is that more convenient than Monero? You end up having to keep track of and think about more than if you had just used Monero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires invoicing (being online). For you to send money to me, I have to create an invoice for you to send money to. You have to ask me for permission to send me money! This is absurd, donations would require more work than what layer 1 provides, and is worse than the fiat system.
Hosting a website or using a centralized service is not a solution to this problem. Privacy is hindered with these alternatives. Why make life difficult when a solution already exist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node network. To send BTC through lightning to someone you don&amp;rsquo;t have a channel open with, you have to HOPE that they are connected indirectly to you via a chain of mutual nodes through another channel you have open. Usability would require the centralization of payment channels and thus is not really secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are probably more issues that I do not know about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are more Monero users than there are channels on Lightning. Atomic swap to Monero is easier than using Lightning channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every piece of BTC has history to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ever heard of adverse selection? Users of BTC that has been tainted are more likely to wash it by methods including mixing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are risking your own BTC, by using mixing services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to mention, these mixing services can get hacked or shut down for money laundering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More expensive than base transaction&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some BTC users think the BTC-XMR swap makes BTC better because BTC users now have another way to wash their money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They promote swapping to XMR and then swapping back to BTC!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are the users who use BTC because it is first, not because they think the tech is the best&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CashFusion obfuscates the sender of the coins but does not protect the owner&amp;rsquo;s balances. If you give me your BCH address, I still know how much you own. You&amp;rsquo;d have to maintain two addresses, one for receiving and one for sending just to get to the basic privacy protections Monero offers without any addon or user knowledge requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CashFusion relies on a single server which means that it&amp;rsquo;s centralized and prone to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/pwupmn/comment/hem7yuc/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&#34;&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt;. If one manages to take out CashFusion, all cash-fusions are unable to be completed. This is worse than Visa and MasterCard who have their own node network. These centralized companies are more decentralized than CashFusion itself! Reminder: Facebook, an almost $1T company went down for hours on Monday, October 4th, 2021 due to a DNS issue. Centralized internet services are all prone to being unusable by a user. The good thing is that there is no risk of losing funds (according to CashFusion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a basic BCH wallet, you now have to use CashFusion&amp;rsquo;s network. This is no different from simply downloading a Monero wallet and swapping BCH for XMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin Cash users have the right mindset; privacy is a human right.
They like the idea of privacy but have this loyalty towards BCH similar to smokers opting for cigarettes over ecigs.
One is objectively better than the other. Crypto is still in its infancy, so it&amp;rsquo;ll take 10 years for people to stop acting like hard drug users who should be using psychedelics instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth--aztec-protocol&#34; &gt;ETH + Aztec Protocol

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2023-04-09: Well well well, zk.money has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/sunsetting-aztec-connect-a786edce5cae&#34;&gt;sunset&lt;/a&gt; so we&amp;rsquo;ll one day see about this &amp;ldquo;Noir protocol&amp;rdquo; the Aztec team has started working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022-09-29: Well I was right, the lack of ETH fungibility is proof that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/#layer-2-powered-by-ethereum&#34;&gt;layer 2&lt;/a&gt; solutions
have a serious flaw and can make you a criminal or sanctioned just for wanting privacy. Tornado Cash being sanctioned means its worse even legally than using Monero. So now I will discuss this Aztec Protocol alternative for now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1560710567249096704?s=20&amp;amp;t=-EDlvVlsKLdgAxGjJSfHJA&#34;&gt;as censorship is already brewing&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before the next popular privacy protocol gets sanctioned, so again, the main argument is that layer 2 protocols simply lack fungibility because observers can tell that a privacy preserving protocol was used and can thus discriminate your coins. With Monero, people have to either accept it for what it is or not accept it at all. All or nothing works; just like https and encryption works. Encryption is an all or nothing thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does &lt;a href=&#34;https://aztec.network/&#34;&gt;Aztec&lt;/a&gt; work? It uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/&#34;&gt;zero-knowledge rollups&lt;/a&gt; meaning that it leverages the
base layer of Ethereum for security, and it guarantees privacy after shielding. You can send shielded amounts to other account aliases and even layer 1 accounts, however the details of receiving are a bit unknown. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do some actual practical research to see its limitations as protocol, but since it is a protocol and not actual currency, it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time until
it too is sanctioned. It was released in 2021 which is why it was not included in the first publishing of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of its issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETH going in and coming out are branded as have being part of Aztec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need 0.1 ETH to start recieving on Aztec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1560710578254925824&#34;&gt;IP logging&lt;/a&gt; and Single-address pending deposit caps (I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what this means)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/layer-by-layer-a-guide-to-aztecs-security-approach-87df087093c0&#34;&gt;Extremely Centralized&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/master/falafel&#34;&gt;Nodes&lt;/a&gt; can be run decentralized, however because of the previous tweet, transactions can only be submitted when the central nodes fail. An antithesis to privacy! This is like the CIA being the only ones allowed to run TOR nodes and only if their nodes went down would other TOR nodes be allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You send/receive with an alias; one alias per wallet (0.1ETH) or something
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this means to receive anonymously, you need another wallet to deposit 0.1ETH into Aztec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposit cap of (5 ETH / 10,000 DAI) so $10,000 and written intension to keep it this way instead of increasing it to 50ETH / 100,000 DAI as promised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, why limit yourself to this centralized privacy protocol, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap&#34;&gt;ETH-XMR&lt;/a&gt; atomic swaps on Arbitrum protocol are around the corner? Atomic swaps combined with better UI/UX front-ends will be the end for these privacy protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;eth--tornado-cash&#34; &gt;ETH + Tornado 🌪 Cash
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#eth--tornado-cash&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Tornado cash compared to CashFusion is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on a centralized service. The web app is a UI for the Tornado: Mixer smart contract. This is a very good use of smart contracts but still, this service does not bring Ethereum up to Monero&amp;rsquo;s default protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, you are restricted to sending and withdrawing 4 different quantities of ETH. How I would use Tornado is if I needed to &amp;ldquo;cleanse&amp;rdquo; ETH, I&amp;rsquo;d have to continuously send ETH to and then withdraw to different addresses each time. That&amp;rsquo;s 9 addresses if I had to move 0.9 ETH, not including transaction fees, the .0X amount of ETH left, and even the time/headache just to accomplish this. Up to $270 would be forfeited in order to get transaction privacy, not balance privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single Monero seed can have an infinite number of accounts and each account can have an infinite number of subaddresses. Instead of subaddresses showing up on the blockchain, a stealth address is created by the sender on the receiver&amp;rsquo;s behalf and shows up on the transaction. Each transaction also has 7 other possible signatures (sender&amp;rsquo;s being a stealth address again) and so the sender is protected as well. The transaction amount is also unknown to observers&lt;/p&gt;

The transaction amount is also unknown to observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tornado Cash is just a mixer and like all mixer&amp;rsquo;s unless all transactions go through Tornado, ETH with a history dating to a Tornado can be seen as more suspicious than non-Tornado ETH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022/09/29: I was right, this flaw I highlighted is now viciously used to enforce the sanctioning of
ETH that has gone through Tornado Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum has one thing over Monero which is smart contracts but just because they are called smart, does not mean they are used in a very smart way. DAO exploit resulted in a hard fork because it affects the founders, then there&amp;rsquo;s the Polygon exploit, and the Indexed Finance exploit. Even after being audited, smart contracts can be exploited. DeFi is simply less secure at the moment compared to proprietary banking systems that are at least insured up to $100,000 per person. It&amp;rsquo;s open-source minus the community inspection. I do hope DeFi improves in the coming years but a question for the reader is why Ethereum and not Solana, Cardano, Stellar? Should Ethereum really move away from proof-of-work? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out in the next subsection.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coins that all into this category include, LTC, GRIN, BEAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/breaking-mimblewimble-privacy-model-84bcd67bfe52&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Breaking Mimblewimble’s Privacy Model&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, we see that there is a serious flaw in Mimblewimble that isn&amp;rsquo;t emphasized enough and its consequences aren&amp;rsquo;t communicated clearly. I highly suggest reading it, but I will simplify it. MimblewWimble works by aggregating multiple individual transactions into on big transaction / CoinJoin on the blockchain. However, since the CoinJoin has to be built one transaction at a time, a sniffer/malicious node that is connected to all other nodes in the network, can simply pick up transactions before the aggregation is finished and unwind the final coinjoin to see the sender and receiver (amounts are safe, but privacy is both identity and amount, not just amount). Privacy isn&amp;rsquo;t real if there&amp;rsquo;s a gate to access it; Privacy is real when the technology is unable to be used against itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-zcash&#34; &gt;On ZCash
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#on-zcash&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to dismantle ZCash. Z-cash offers privacy optionally and not even by default. That is the only reason it is on more exchanges than Monero. To my knowledge, no exchange that supports ZCash and not Monero allows shielded deposits (50% sure) and withdrawals. Additionally, transparent transactions are the default, most transactions on the blockchain were transparent ones, and users have to trust that ZCash was set up without any bad actors. Transactions being transparent by default make shielded transactions stick out. This leads to discrimination and suspicion of users that use shielded transactions. In addition to these issues, ZCash gives 10% of the total supply to their own founders. This goes against equitable decentralization and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ZCash does not protect transaction values for even transparent → shielded addresses. Having two types of addresses means that senders can discriminate against shielded address users. This two type system means that common behaviours such as transacting in short periods of time can be susceptible to blockchain analysis and has been traced before by even an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/The8Connor/status/1284900368116330497&#34;&gt;individual&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;having unshielded TX inherently make shielded ones less private&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hubbvg/comment/fym8yn9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&#34;&gt;u/lol_VEVO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more insult to privacy advocates, the founder - Zooka - once (drunkenly) tweeted that they would add privacy by default and that they would take it away from criminals. Needing to trust the setup does make it possible… The fact that the founder holds this opinion shows us that ZCash isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in privacy as a human right, only privacy for those who hold the right opinion. By the way, the definition of criminal varies from country to country as I said in the last section. I&amp;rsquo;m attacking the vision of ZCash&amp;rsquo;s leader which is fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Monero community, one of Monero&amp;rsquo;s paid workers was also working for another crypto project. There is more to this story, but the conflict of interest was brought up in the community and the worker resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general fund was also questioned and a general fund report was created.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#proof-of-stake-pos-vs-delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we compare staking to working, let us first decide what&amp;rsquo;s objectively a better staking mechanism. DPoS suffers from even more issues compared to normal staking. Delegation is not more democratic, it&amp;rsquo;s more centralized.
The rich have more votes, increase their delegate&amp;rsquo;s likelihood of winning, and giving the rich voters a bigger share of the rewards.
There is a sacrifice of centralization in the name of scalability and even according to Vitalik (ETH founder), there are incentives for the delegates to collude.
In conclusion DPoS is worse than PoS so I will compare PoW to PoS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now we have come to the discussion of PoW vs PoS. Unlike previous PoS critics, I&amp;rsquo;ll be arguing that PoW is better than PoS from the equity point of view and that PoS benefits the wealthy more than PoW.
PoS critics usually try to argue that PoS is less secure than PoW, but I have never seen them respond back to the solutions proposed that punish bad actors. That is why I don&amp;rsquo;t consider them as solid arguments and will merely mention them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In PoW, there are costs to validating transactions in a block. The mining rewards are an incentive but a cost must be taken for a chance to get the rewards. There is real risk involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With PoS, the rich arguably get richer. A better argument is that the rich do not distribute or invest their coins in order to get richer. With PoW, the rich will have to actively spend their crypto (assuming a crypto world), distributing their coins to hardware companies and then the working class, in order to simply get the chance of more money. There is a measurable physical cost associated with it. Rewards are distributed to those who put in the most work, and not people who had the most. PoS is like a Central Bank giving newly printed money more often to the people who have saved the most. What&amp;rsquo;s to stop the UN to start a resolution that requires countries to buy up all PoS coins and then stake them together? Then the supply of ETH is fully controlled by the government at no cost to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This point is more economical and theoretical than about PoS: Inflation is when prices increase year over year. If done correctly, there is a higher cost to money hoarders than those who have an appropriate amount saved. The cost to live should be non-increasing but the cost of luxury goods should be non-decreasing and a marginal property tax can help tackle wealth inequality without direct discrimination. The wealthy should be able to live where they want and own as many properties as they desire but they should be dissuaded in raising the cost to live for others. I say all this because crypto should not benefit the fortunate more than the unfortunate. It should benefit innovation, and risk. I have purposely excluded investment because a scam also requires an investment and that is not something crypto should reward. Pre-mined coins disproportionately rewards those in power and not necessarily those that take on risk. The first buyers take on more risk than those who are facilitating the presale. There is more trust required than a PoW coin that simply utilizes users&amp;rsquo; CPU. The price of the token is determine by those that mine it and are not set by the founders/upper class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@abhisharm/understanding-proof-of-stake-through-its-flaws-part-3-long-range-attacks-672a3d413501&#34;&gt;Weak Subjectivity&lt;/a&gt;
When a node comes online for the first time, how will the node know the hash of the valid chain? In PoW, the correct chain is objectively the longest chain which is determined by computation power. In PoS, the new node will have to trust other nodes to be broadcasting the right information. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at Vitalik&amp;rsquo;s argument: &amp;ldquo;consider the kind of situation where weak subjectivity by itself would compromise a blockchain&amp;rsquo;s security. In such a world, powerful corporate or nation state actors would have the ability to somehow convince an entire community that block hash B was the block hash of block XXXYYY when most of them saw at the time and have stored in their own computers that the block hash of block XXXYYY was A, but for some reason such powerful actors would not have the ability to trick users into accepting a different location from where they download their client software.&amp;rdquo;
According to Vitlak, a bad actor cannot set up more than half the network&amp;rsquo;s nodes and broadcast the wrong hash such that when the nodes restart due to a network update, they won&amp;rsquo;t rely on false information? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that the cost to set up 51% of broadcasting nodes is considerably less than the cost to achieve 51% of the network&amp;rsquo;s hash rate.
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit this argument is very fuzzy, but I am open to removing it completely if one is willing to provide an unbiased risk analysis of weak subjectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another argument is PoS is permissioned vs PoW&amp;rsquo;s permissionless. To get Monero, one can mine it on any CPU. For PoS, one needs to buy the crypto from another entity to participate in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A premine was probably required if there was never PoW and so PoS coins reward the rich at no cost to them. A system that favours merit over the oligarchs is always fairer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other arguments that other people use (not part of my actual argument, just something to think about): Accumulated work (reversing the PoS chain is faster than than the PoW chain), finality requires 2/3 instead of 51%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that ETH 2.0 will show everyone if PoS is here to stay or is significantly less secure than PoW, but what it won&amp;rsquo;t show that it is more equitable than PoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Monero. Monero would only adopt PoS if the community voted for it and for the time being, that seems unlikely. Any Monero fork that uses PoS will be used less than Monero itself, and by the network effect, Monero will be used, not PoSonero.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have determined that PoW is more secure than PoS, let&amp;rsquo;s figure out why PoW is better on Monero than the other PoW cryptos like BTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a proof-of-work network to be secure, it needs to prevent centralization and advantages. Cryptos like BTC and ZEC are all compatible with ASICs and thus prone to centralization by big corporations with ASIC farms. Monero however, uses the (4x audited) RandomX algorithm which is tweaked to run worse on GPUs and ASICs compared to CPUs by making use of as many CPU features as possible. Before &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/blob/master/doc/design.md&#34;&gt;RandomX&lt;/a&gt;, Monero needed hard forks to render any specialized ASICs useless. However with RandomX, the virtualization techniques used increases the complexity of implementing a RandomX ASIC to the point where an ASIC would end up being a CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic behind ASIC resistance is as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ggdp8e/comment/fq0332a/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&#34;&gt;follows&lt;/a&gt;: PoW algorithms are meant to be inefficient for ALL parties. ASICs allow for hardware advantages and thus greater efficiency for some parties than the individual. The ASIC manufacturer maintains a hardware advantage over other miners and can thus produce more hashes per Watt than other miners. This is objectively more centralized. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-md&#34; data-lang=&#34;md&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let CPU hashes per core = x hashes / watt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#fff;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;# SHA-256
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#fff;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ASIC hashes per core = nx Hashes / Watt, n &amp;gt; 1 [Advantage to specialist]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#fff;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;# RandomX
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#fff;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ASIC hashes per core &amp;lt; x Hashes / Watt [due to Randomness + Virtualisation]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASICs cannot be made to outperform CPUs since the entire algorithm creates a random program that leverages as many CPU features as possible.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only would it be costly and difficult to create an ASIC to run RandomX more efficiently, but there is also a massive risk that Monero can simply hard fork again and use a modified algorithm. There are more lucrative opportunities for profit-driven firms than to try and create a complex ASIC for an algorithm purposely created to make the process difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transaction-fees-and-liquidating-monero&#34; &gt;Transaction Fees, and Liquidating Monero
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#transaction-fees-and-liquidating-monero&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m only including this for everyone to get the idea that transaction fees are only horrible for ETH at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To properly compare fees, we will normalize each cryptocurrency market cap to that of Bitcoins, to get the normalized price and thus normalized USD fee. For most cryptos, transactions correlate with fees but not with Monero; the opposite is true, one factor being dynamic block sizes that end up lowering the fees per transaction as transactions/block increases. The argument for fees is to penalize spam, which is the attack on NANO that went on for months. The only incentive to run a NANO node is to accept NANO…The entire worth is derived from the network effect and not actual technology or cost like PoW cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Ethereum, the normalized Fee is poised to change when ETH 2 rolls out which will allegedly make it competitive with Solana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Monero, transaction fees actually decrease as transactions increase due to dynamic block sizes. You can read more about dynamic block sizes in my Intro to Monero at the beginning of this article. If the minimum transaction fees are deemed too high, Monero can always reduce it in a hard fork, but at the moment there is no need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Stellar, the fee was back-calculated from $0.00025 / transaction currently. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s tied to fiat or just transaction traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say about transaction fees. Anything less than $2 / transaction is good since credit card transactions cost %1.5–3 and thus sellers can accept crypto transactions that are short up 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply caps and block reward reductions may play a role in the future, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather wait and see make baseless speculations.
This is an unknown type of risk with Bitcoin in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Monero and Stellar both use the ISO 4217 currency standard for international currencies just like XAU is for one troy ounce of gold. This reason is a semantic one, so that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s last.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not important to the argument, however it is important for Monero users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now if you hate Monero, you will be tempted to start throwing a temper tantrum about Monero being de-listed and the &amp;ldquo;fear of regulations&amp;rdquo;. Guess what you can use instead? You can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://fixedfloat.com/&#34;&gt;fixedfloat&lt;/a&gt; to exchange XMR to XLM for a 0.5% fee and then deposit XLM on the exchange you use to sell immediately to fiat. Make sure the exchange you use can be trusted or that any crypto you deposit can be recovered through at least legal means. The reason I chose XLM and not any other crypto is because I did the math, and the math says that Stellar is the cheapest today to use as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To buy Monero, just do the same as above, but the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder, with Monero, fees reduce as transactions per block go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-a-matching-bitcoin&#34; &gt;Scenario A: Matching Bitcoin
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#scenario-a-matching-bitcoin&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently 272503 transactions per day on Bitcoin,
so we need to check if even modern hard drives and SSDs can handle this amount of transactions on the Monero blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From xmrchain.net, the average transaction size on Monero for the last 25 transactions is 2.05 kB.
We&amp;rsquo;ll use 3 kB per transaction to account for any future upgrades and other block data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since block times are ~2 minutes, instead of 10, the transactions per block is: 272503/24/30 ~= 379 transactions per block.
A block&amp;rsquo;s size is 379 * 3 = 1.137 MB. Even poor internet download speeds could handle this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of transactions would be 1.137 * 30 * 24 * 365 = 298,803.6 MB = 300GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 300GB a year, we use 3 TB a decade, and 9 TB every three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we need to spend $500 for a 16 TB hard drive or $1,000 for a 8 TB SSD.
This is the cost in the present, but overtime storage prices will go down.
By the usage described before, an SSD will last 2.5 decades and an HDD will last 5 decades!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we will figure out the transactions/day limit. Let&amp;rsquo;s say in the future, Monero upgrades to allow nodes
to use data for 10 years. That is, any transactions incorporating outputs that are more than 10 years old
will be considered invalid. At 8TB/decade, we get 800GB per year which is x2.67 more than our previous
scenario. 800 / 365 / 3 = 730,593 transactions per day. And again, this is under the assumption that transactions become
46% bigger than they currently are. If we use the present average of 2.05 kB, 800 GB / 365 / 2.05 KB = 1,069,161 transactions per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, max transactions per day is within the range [730,593, 1,069,161]&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monero offers fungibility, all aspects of financial privacy without requiring users to know of specific techniques, and an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work system. These three important topics might make Monero the best cryptocurrency as of today, but its open-minded and always-improving technology is why it will continue to be the best. Monero is digital cash, not a Security.&lt;/p&gt;
