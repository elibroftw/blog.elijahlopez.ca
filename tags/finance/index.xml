      <title>Gold vs S&amp;P500 Annualized Return by Month Invested (Jan 1975 - Sep 2025)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gold crossed $4,000 per troy ounce on October 7th. Given this milestone, I wanted to investigate the claim that gold is a better investment than the S&amp;amp;P500. When people usually share their charts showing Gold versus the S&amp;amp;P500 &lt;em&gt;index&lt;/em&gt;, there are a few biases I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed. Of course, the same day I started doing my analysis on this topic, CNBC puts out an article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/gold-vs-sp500-returns.html&#34;&gt;gold vs. sp500 long term returns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most egregious bias in my opinion, is the investment year is cherry-picked (e.g. peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000), and along it comparing against NASDAQ instead of the S&amp;amp;P500. To account for this bias, I have charted the difference in returns for all years, and annualized them to make teh results more digestible, since total returns aren&amp;rsquo;t comparable across years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another bias is that people will cherry pick years very long ago without accounting for executive order 6102 which prohibited owning gold from 1933 until the &amp;ldquo;International Development Association Appropriations Act of 1975&amp;rdquo; was passed, legalizing owning gold starting from January 1st, 1975. This bias is accounted for by restricting the time frame from January 1st, 1975 to the most recent data available for comparison (September 1st, 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third bias is comparing against the S&amp;amp;P500 index rather than teh S&amp;amp;P500 total return index which incorporates dividends reinvested. Big shout out to Robert Shiller for maintaining this dataset for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End date: Sep-2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_vs_sp500_plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, since 1975, the S&amp;amp;P 500 manages to outperform gold on a y/y basis 70% of the time (note that this is based on investing at the start of the year). The cool thing about gold is that it has a Beta coefficient of around 0.5 (Yahoo, using GLD ETF as a proxy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the initial plots which show the performance for the two different types of investments, I noticed that since 1997 to the present day (include the monster returns of 2024 and 2025), there are periods where an investment in gold - a zero-cashflow generating asset - would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed the S&amp;amp;P500 - cash flow generating securities. After that there are periods where an investment in the S&amp;amp;P500 would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed gold. This makes some sense once you factor in that gold is not correlated to S&amp;amp;P500. Once the market crashed and started going up in March 2009, due to the great financial crisis, there was opportunity to shift from gold into the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use a 10-year window, the results are bit more different, suggesting that over the long-term the S&amp;amp;P500 will outperform gold. The periods where the S&amp;amp;P500 outperforms are taller and the dot-com bursts are deeper compared to the all time annualized performance, however even on a 10 year period the pre-1995 bull market provided excess returns over gold as well as the post-GFC bull market. These make it very clear that gold is not a buy always hold forever instrument but rather an instrument to bring into play when investors speculate that the risk-free real interest rates is lower than what they desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_10yr_rolling.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price 10 year window&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely a year (2012) where you should&amp;rsquo;ve sold gold for bonds or stocks. The year is 2012 and inflation starts dipping below 2%. The Feds start cutting rates, however its clear that holding USD will provide a provide a positive enough risk-free real rate of return. So what happens to gold? It falls to its &amp;ldquo;fair value&amp;rdquo; and stays there since inflation is being tamed, as made clear with interest rates rising from 2016 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_sp500_ratio_plot_35_years.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Performance&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions that arise after looking at the graphs are why is gold going up in 2024 and 2025, whether this is similar to 2012, how to avoid another dot-com bubble situation, and lastly, how do we know when the top is in regarding the business/debt cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the provided charts, the gold price rise seems to be a reflection of both the  &lt;strong&gt;declining confidence&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s ability to control inflation as well as its status as a safe haven asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is inversely correlated with the expected risk-free real interest rate. Gold is also seen as a safe-haven asset. Meaning that the real interest rate could be flat, but the existence of some fear, like tariffs, could cause mass buying of gold. What factors determine the expected risk-free real interest rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expected inflation rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2025/08/20/us-budget-deficit-forecast-us1-trillion-higher-over-next-decade-watchdog-says/&#34;&gt;increase in deficit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tariffs (import prices are higher)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury Yields (1yr or 10yr)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Feds Fund rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/treasury-yields-and-gold-prices-breaking-expectations&#34;&gt;Treasury yields and gold prices: breaking expectations (March 25, 2025)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the inflation data, the 1yr treasury bill yields, and the actual Feds Fund rates, a relationship can somewhat be determined between expected inflation, expected risk-free real interest rates, and thus gold prices. When the expected risk-free real interest rate falls, gold is viewed as the stronger store of value. This seems to be because treasuries get crowded out due to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/10/staff-analytical-note-2025-25/#Money-market-mutual-funds-have-experienced-high-growth&#34;&gt;lag&lt;/a&gt; in people pulling money out of money market funds as interest rates get cut. The lag is 1yr.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#fishers-equation-and-real-interest-rates&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept of real interest rates comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bu-473-investment-management#interest-rates-and-inflation-rates&#34;&gt;Fisher equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_e=N(1-t)-\pi_e&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;real risk-free required rate of return&amp;rdquo; varies by investor type. This is possibly due to differences in taxation. If all participants seek similar post-tax real rates of return, then where they are situated may affect how the bid on securities, and if the market is small enough, it may crowd out investors with higher marginal tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Tax Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions based in zero-tax jurisdictions could drive down pre-tax real returns for all market participants to match their own post-tax expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commodity Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;: institutions are less likely to be able to crowd out commodities like gold, thus it gives all investors ane better chance at pursuing investments that meet their desired risk-free real rates of return when treasury bills don&amp;rsquo;t meet the bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Outlook&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price Ratio over the last 30 years, a gold price crash appears unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Valuation&lt;/strong&gt; (Chart 2): The TR CAPE excess yield metric suggests the S&amp;amp;P 500 is not currently in a speculative bubble. This metric compares the yield of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio against the inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TR CAPE excess yield metric is the difference between the yield of the SP500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio minus the 10-year Treasury yield adjusted for inflation. The implication is that when treasuries offer a better real return than the market, the market is definitely in a bubble since it would be be poised to underperform treasuries on a real basis for the next 10 years. That or it would require a long-term sustaining bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPE takes into account the business cycle and TR takes into account the various method of returning cash to shareholders (dividends, buybacks, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;systemic-crashes&#34; &gt;Systemic Crashes
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#systemic-crashes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market crashing is systemic. There are multiple factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Cycles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a business cycle is going down, it is called a recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment ratios will go up and down just due to the nature of a business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business cycle is what central banks are tasked at shortening, however it is not a solved problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally I think recessions are characterized based on the employment data because unemployment is the problem, not a fall in economic growth. If economic growth exists and people are unemployed, then there is still a crisis because people are struggling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless, a traditional GDP based recession metric is clearly a follow up on a decrease in employment, where the recession becomes a reality if the loss in jobs is long-enough to cause a decrease in consumption, which would result in a decrease in earnings, which decreases stock prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt crisis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recession becomes a debt crisis when a lot of capital is tied to &amp;ldquo;never ending growth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debt crisis occurs when a lot of capital is tied to being owed money from over-leveraged entities who can go under due to even the smallest of mishaps. In the GFC, the subprime mortgage instrument combined with over-leverage meant that a minor real estate correction would wipe out the Lehman Brothers, and of course a fall in employment is going to prevent real estate from continuing to go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black swan events (e.g. lockdowns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in the possibility of a black swan event (e.g. COVID-19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharp rise in interest rates causing valuations to plummet due to a higher required rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, interest rates stopped rising. This in turn started a bull market due to risk-premiums being fixed. As interest rates were hiked in 2022, the market risk-premium necessitates that the required rate of return is higher. When the required rate of return rises without the stock market already having corrected, a rise in the required rate of return (based on expectations not just rate announcements), would immediately cause downward pressure on stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34; &gt;Looking Forward
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#looking-forward&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to pursue live graphs that show a simple risk factor as to how likely forward earnings will miss expectations (and thus cause a systemic crash) barring external and black swan events. On top of that, because systemic crashes cause even good stocks to go down, there needs to be a super simple tool that can figure out which stocks were oversold. In a market crash, one of the reasons for asset sales is the lack of liquidity itself! Stock valuations aren&amp;rsquo;t just a reflection of fundamentals but also of liquidity (supply &amp;amp; demand). Some factors that are interesting to me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation (to predict interest rate announcements, however bank analysts will probably do this themselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jobs data (to predict and visualize where the economy is in the business cycle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-free interest rates (to know what the market&amp;rsquo;s required rate of return is)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the required rate of return is a combination of Beta, equity-risk premium, and the risk-free return. The equity risk-premium is not necessarily static, however it must be a positive number. My theory is that it depends on the various opportunity costs available at any point in time. As time goes forward and as investment innovations increase, equity-risk premiums should be rising, however they can fluctuate due to government policies providing or removing incentives for certain industries and sectors. We must also be aware that the equity risk premium is affected by investable wealth. Meaning that the larger the security in terms of market capitalization, the lower the equity risk premium is to compensate for the fact that more capital to invest also means less available investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year treasury prices and yield versus gold (specifically for analyzing periods of distress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several prominent economists have warned about speculative bubbles and irrational market behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/strong&gt; (December 5, 1996, &amp;ldquo;The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets&amp;hellip; But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Franco Modigliani&lt;/strong&gt;, Nobel Laureate (March 30, 2000, New York Times):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The expectation of growth produces the growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up. But once you are convinced that it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34; &gt;TL;DR
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASIC-Resistance PoW Algorithm allows mining on devices not exclusively allocated for mining, without being at as much of a disadvantage to a ASIC-friendly PoW Algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows mining using existing hardware without paying liquidation fees or profit margins to increase hash rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not have perverse incentives for ASIC manufactures; i.e. if an entity can improve ASICs internally,  they only sell it to the public once mining said blockchain becomes less profitable than selling to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Botnets = free hash rate security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOES NOT REQUIRE MARKET CAP TO BE HIGHER FOR AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY (NETWORK SECURITY).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for society, it does not reallocate capital to technology used exclusively for the purpose of mining a single cryptocurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing for profit miners to buy specialized hardware increases their risk of mining a non-defacto cryptocurrency whereas general compute can be reallocated as soon as operational profits drop. With Asics, companies would just stop mining and declare bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34; &gt;Preface
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#preface&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider two coins, where the only difference between the two is that one uses an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm, (called powR), the other is ASIC-friendly (called powF) (definition: it is mined most efficiently by specialized hardware that specializes in said proof-of-work algorithm, and is less effective at other tasks due to the nature of the coin requiring new ASICs to be created). Both have an equal number of not-for-profit miners who invested the same amount of money. e.g. Ryzen CPUs vs ASICs. Without introducing the other miners, the difficulty (measured in total comparable hashrate, TCH) is the same at the moment. One point to note is that network hashrates are usually not comparable between blockchains that use different proof of work algorithms. It&amp;rsquo;s a question of cryptography, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re only interested in the concept of comparable difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-for-profit-miners&#34; &gt;Not For Profit Miners
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-for-profit-miners&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;rsquo;s introduce zero-capex (capital expenditure) not-for-profit miners. These are people who already own the computing hardware and repurpose it to mine the coin. Due to the explicit nature of the ASIC-friendly coin, the TCH of the ASIC-resistant coin is going to go up by a higher percentage. I will prove it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume for every dollar in investment and operational cost, A(ASIC)s are more efficient at mining powF than G(ENERIC) hardware is, and for powR, ASIC is less efficient (and thus does not exist for powR). This is a valid assumption because the definition of powF is to be more efficient using ASICS. Even if powF is unprofitable to mine with A, it would be even more unprofitable to mine with G. Got it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a demonstration. Say the efficiency is 2x. There is older generic hardware G&amp;rsquo;, which is said to be half as efficient as G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 3 miners/pools contributing to each network with the following hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two miners with hardware G&amp;rsquo; (said to be less powerful than G), want to start mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA G&#39;
New difficulty: (6.5:6 = 108.3%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG G&amp;rsquo;:
New difficulty: (3.5:3 = 116.7%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the powF fan will sell their existing hardware for money, which will most probably be done at a discount to its market value, and thus will be buying something that is not exactly half of A. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = $1k
G = $1k
G&amp;rsquo; = $500 (market value)
G&amp;rsquo; sold = $499 (G&amp;rsquo; is not a hot commodity by definition, and must be sold at a discount to market value to get money in hand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that G&amp;rsquo; can be sold for market value, there exists some person with hardware G&amp;rsquo; that wants to use only a % of their hardware for mining. This is true, and so even in the best case scenario, it will be more profitable to mine powR than powF with existing hardware. It actually gets even more insane if you design the most ASIC-friendly algorithm. The greater the efficiency of ASICs at mining powF compared to Generics, the greater the increase in difficulty required from powR before existing hardware users even consider mining powR (from a profitability standpoint). To recap, for not-for-profit users that don&amp;rsquo;t want to dedicate their existing hardware to mine their preferred blockchain, the users of powR will be increasing the difficulty of the respective blockchain by a higher percentage than the users of powF (assuming equal users and equal existing hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34; &gt;Botnets and Cost Advantaged Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With botnets, powR is getting mined more than powF and it&amp;rsquo;s still proportional to how ASIC-friendly powF is. If ASICs are 10x more economically efficient than generic hardware, then botnets are going to prefer powR for 10x more price-adjuated difficulty (i.e. share of TCH * price of powR has to be less than the same calcualtion of powF). Botnets mine powR, and have an incentive to not compromise the network as it is profitable without operational costs. With botnets selling the powR coin for profit, the powR market cap will be going down over time at a rate faster than the powF coin, but the multiplicative rate of defline will not be greater than the difficulty multiplier (otherwise botnets would mine powF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ASIC-resistant algorithm powR has a higher difficulty than the ASIC-friendly algorithm powF, even before we introduce profit-seeking entities. What this also means is that if profit to mine is zero or less, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for a bad actor to take over the ASIC-friendly network than the ASIC-Resistance network (every $ invested represents a higher share of hashrate for the ASIC-friendly blockchain compared to every $ invested in the ASIC-resistance blockchain). &lt;em&gt;Note that in the long-run, due to how relatively low the barriers to entry &lt;del&gt;will be&lt;/del&gt; are to mine blocks, mining profit (excluding speculation) does go to zero.&lt;/em&gt; Even for ASIC-friendly blockchains, since they want ASICs to be created by anyone (and thus accessible to as many people). It&amp;rsquo;s actually worse if ASIC-friendly algorithms don&amp;rsquo;t want ASICs to be easily created. If the market for ASICs are not &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/what-is-perfect-competition&#34;&gt;perfect competition&lt;/a&gt;, the the players in the market can simply gatekeep their ASICs and mine with an advantage, which could also compromise how decentralized the mining is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point, it is less profitable &lt;em&gt;to buy hardware&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of mining powR rather than powF because mining powR would increase difficulty by a smaller percentage than mining powF (assuming the same initial capital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a hostile actor, it is cheaper to attack and take over the powF blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this statement to be false, the assumptions are unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person that would rather mine using their existing hardware than swap it. (hypothetically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swapping generic hardware for specialized hardware has zero loss of capital. (false due to used goods having varied prices and have also depreciated, especially electronics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person who would mine using generic hardware part-time. (false since Monero is proof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the security of a blockchain (difficulty) should not depend on the assumption that the market cap of the blockchain is high enough that state actors can&amp;rsquo;t meaningfully impact the blockchain. Why? Because in the real world, every blockchain grows its market cap over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;profit-seeking-entities&#34; &gt;Profit-Seeking Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#profit-seeking-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two types of profit-seeking entities. One is speculative, which all coins loves, the other is non-speculative and looks at operational profits (that is they sell for fiat immediately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generic-hardware-entities&#34; &gt;Generic Hardware Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#generic-hardware-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For entities (individuals and companies) that already hold generic hardware, they will be checking the relative profitability of each coin. In the instance of dedicated mining, entities will swap generic hardware for specialized hardware, thus increasing difficulty of powF. However, if the profitability is the same between the two coins, the generic hardware entity will always prefer mining powR, because it does not require swapping to ASICs. Thus we can assume that powR still has a higher difficulty than powF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of part-timer generic entities, powR is going to have a higher profit margin as mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;investors&#34; &gt;Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A for-profit entity, ELL&amp;rsquo;s Mining Corporation, is a pure-play profit-maximizing (obviously) blockchain mining company. It has come across both the ASIC-friendly blockchain and the ASIC-Resistance blockchain. The company DOES NOT SPECULATE IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND SELLS ALL MINED CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR PROFIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All mined coins are sold for fiat profit. This is similar to Ethereum swap trade front-runners (bots) which are coded to sell all coins to profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELL&amp;rsquo;s mining corporation is a profit-seeking cryptocurrency mining corporation that seeks to maximize profits. It has a positive hurdle rate and will not invest for zero net present value (unfortunately my corporate finance notes are still in Word and Excel files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now mining powR is less preferable to mining powF, but there are three factors that favour powR to powF. There&amp;rsquo;s two factors that make powF less enticing, but one of them assumes that R&amp;amp;D would need to be done to create ASICs (which in that case, the blockchain is very insecure). The second factor would be that the ASIC vendors have profit margins, but that is an argument to showcase that requiring ASICs is a waste of money on top of providing less security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;powf-is-more-profitable-than-powr-and-has-positive-profitability&#34; &gt;powF is more profitable than powR and has Positive Profitability
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#powf-is-more-profitable-than-powr-and-has-positive-profitability&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the assumption is really that mining powF has a positive net present value. We already established that powF is more profitable to mine than powR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for powF to have a positive and higher net present value compared to powR? The profit-seeking entity will compare projected cashflows from a mining operation (assuming selling to fiat) for both blockchains, and then use a discount rate to figure out the present value of future cashflows. The discount rates &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; differ due the inherent risk of buying ASICs to mine a coin that isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to have the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure-play companies are going to invest in ASICs and mine powF, however the hurdle rate used is higher than powR&amp;rsquo;s. The hurdle rates will never be the same because there is inherent risk in investing in ASICs versus generic hardware. In cases like a mining company, if the only barrier is capital, then the barrier to entry is very low, and its possible that gross profits can become negative due to competitors obtaining lower operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually even higher for ASIC-minded coins because some ASIC vendors are going to have perverse incentives to gate-keep the best ASIC to themselves, and only releasing better ASICs once the other vendors do. AMD and Intel have no incentive to do this with generic hardware, due to the pure-play nature and how multipurpose nature of their hardware, but the ASIC company is very well versed with the blockchain they designed their ASIC for. There is no incentive to even release the first ASIC of the powF coin unless ,,mining profitability is lower than ASIC profit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gross profits are negative, that means revenue from mining is less than the cost to run the hardware. In the case of the generic hardware, once gross-profit is negative, they will switch to general compute, however for the ASICs, the business will simply stop mining. This means that the bankruptcy risk is higher with ASIC mining companies. When the bankruptcy risk is higher, so to will the required rate of return of the company&amp;rsquo;s investors and as such a higher hurdle rate is required from powF. All this proves is that  powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority to powR depends entirely on price. In practice, you could argue that an ASIC-friendly coin is more secure than ASIC-resistance coins just solely based on the market cap difference, but this is true even between two ASIC-friendly coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security of a blockchain should not assume that the net present value will always be highest for mining blockchain compared to other areas, especially from the bigger picture that each of these mining companies could be publicly traded. If the profitability is lower for blockchain companies, less capital will be provided as more companies provide the financial picture. Bitcoin mining companies are great examples of this, and showcases how valuation is entirely dictated by the speculative nature of the operation. In other words, mining can be unprofitable, and in these cases speculative investors are driving security under their assumption that the price will go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculative-investors&#34; &gt;Speculative Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#speculative-investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculative entities mine coins based on speculation that that the coins will appreciate in value. These firms do not care about operational profit, and thus its rationale that they will allocate the same amount of money to each blockchain they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason to ignore what speculative investors do is because they flee the moment the market hits the top. Tullip mania, Canada&amp;rsquo;s condo market. Speculative investors invest not because of fundamentals, but because of a speculation that the price will keep going up. If speculators are the only reason the price goes up, then at some point, when speculation or authentic demand dries up, speculators flee. There are two scenarios really, one is where powF and powR are both going down in price. In this case there is no speculator demand and security is still better for powR. In the scenario where powF&amp;rsquo;s price is going up faster than powR (which could be slowly going down), the price would have to make powF profitable, and at some point, the selling by profit-seeking entities will stop the price from going up further. But of course, block rewards get cut! But then less profit-seeking entities contribute to the security. The price would have to go up faster than the block rewards get cut for profit-seeking entities to increase security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority depends on 1) significant botnet that finds mining powR to be the most profitable (implies that powR has economic value) 2) speculators pushing price of powF at a faster growth rate than powR (for life). This last point is very disturbing. In so many cases, speculation has resulted in devastation. A great example is Canada Condo market. Speculation that leveraged condo purchases would outperform the stock market kept pushing the price of condos and pre-construction condos higher where new builds of condos were reaching peak levels. As soon as the authentic demand was softened, the speculators left, and now housing starts in Ontario have collapsed to great financial recession levels! If this happens to powF, then the miners go bankrupt, since their ASICs (balance sheet assets) would plummet in value at the same time that profitability goes down. At least in the case of general compute, there is a bottom to the asset price, but with ASICs and a speculative sell-off, things would look seriously bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monero&#34; &gt;Monero

    &lt;a href=&#34;#monero&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other non-security argument for why ASIC-resistance proof-of-work is better than ASIC-friendly proof-of-work is one rooted in decentralized and fairness. The purpose is that the blockchain wants to prevent any entity from having a superior dollar invested to hashrate ratio than the common man. Rather than be super ASIC-friendly, Monero went with being super anti-ASIC, which has the additional benefit of not requiring specialized hardware to get started with mining Monero in a competitive environment. Each miner is incentivized to invest in the most efficient general purpose CPUs and to lower their operational costs rather than the alternative which is buying some other hardware which requires the former having economical value to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Proof of Work algorithm prevents specialized mining hardware from dominating the network and allows for fair distribution of block rewards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, Monero 0.15 was released with a permanent proof-of-work algorithm, RandomX, which was designed to run most effectively on general CPUs. Before, this Monero would tweak its proof-of-work algorithm often to ensure ASICs would not be mining Monero. One could argue that Monero lost security every time they did this, however these ASIC miners only existed due to having a competitive advantage compared to the 20% of non-ASIC miners. When the algorithm is no longer ASIC-friendly, it allows more players to mine Monero for profit and thus increases decentralization and network security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34; &gt;Conclusion
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Conclusion, the idea that ASIC-friendliness is a superior security model to ASIC-resistance, is complete fantasy, based on an incomplete picture of how profit-seeking individuals in the real world functions. When the security of a blockchain depends on its price and thus profitability to mine, it diminished the fundamental purpose of the blockchain!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Away From Stock Picking</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/moving-away-from-stock-picking/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 22:48:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/moving-away-from-stock-picking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a look at my portfolio&amp;rsquo;s benchmark today, $&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf&#34;&gt;DISV&lt;/a&gt;, and it confirmed a conclusion I had come to earlier in the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the capital to call yourself a hedge fund manager and hire some analysts, you&amp;rsquo;re better off building an international portfolio that isn&amp;rsquo;t concentrated around large-cap US companies. Seeking alpha in the stock market is for hobbyists, not investors with a preference for investing passively! Alpha is the excess return between a portfolio and its benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-to-stock-picking-and-sp500&#34; &gt;Alternative to Stock Picking and SP500
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-to-stock-picking-and-sp500&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least three biases that exist in the status quo investment advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US dominance (regarding VOO, ZSP.TO),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favouritsm given to 100 (NASDAQ 100) / 500 &lt;strong&gt;US-listed large-cap&lt;/strong&gt; stocks over 5,000+ global stocks (1,500 small-cap value, 3800 core equity) (regarding QQQ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-cap weighted holdings even though market cap is not correlated to future returns and may increase portfolio risk instead of decreasing portfolio risk (regarding RSP, VEQT.TO, EQL.TO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To correct for these biases, without picking individual stocks, a well thought out portfolio made up solely of ETFs, would look something like the below. This is what I would recommend to everyone, at least as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not mainstream. I plan on investing exclusively in DISV and VSUX exclusively since my portfolio already has a lot of US and Canadian equity exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International ex-USA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (35%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VSUX (30%)
Index ETF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA (25% of the global economy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$AVUV (15%): US small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$EQL.TO / $RSP (10%): US equal-weighted SP500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discretionary (10%)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either stock picking or one of the ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market/#converting-cad-to-usd-and-back-norberts-gambit&#34;&gt;Norbert&amp;rsquo;s gambit&lt;/a&gt; to buy the US-listed ETFs, then I recommend to just buy VEQT.TO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can adjust this mix to max out at 90%, leaving you with 10% for discretionary investing. US investors can just ignore the 10% domestic allocation and use it for discretionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-portfolio&#34; &gt;My Portfolio
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#my-portfolio&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of research these past few weeks hunting for small-cap value stocks and mid-cap growth stocks and although I&amp;rsquo;ve started building positions in the stocks I believe will outperform my benchmark (GOOGL), I have decided that this will be the last time I do such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you only need 20 stocks to reduce your portfolio risk to something close to systemic/market risk. The problem though is that you will miss out on stocks if you aren&amp;rsquo;t constantly revaluating your current picks and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I use GOOGL as my benchmark for &lt;em&gt;picking stocks&lt;/em&gt;, my portfolio&amp;rsquo;s benchmark is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (60%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VXUS (40%): core equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;m done building up my portfolio and buying the discretionary stocks on my &lt;em&gt;Buy list&lt;/em&gt;, future deposits will be invested in DISV and VXUS. I value my time and these ETFs can definitely save mine while meeting my investment preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those new to investing, feel free to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/investing/&#34;&gt;How to Invest in the Stock Market as a Canadian&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dollar-cost-averaging&#34; &gt;Dollar Cost Averaging
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dollar-cost-averaging&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to not pick stocks is that when you go to invariably dollar cost average via a portfolio rebalance, you are trying to time the market and you can end up getting burned. It&amp;rsquo;s much better to take it easy for at least 3 months before you dollar cost average for the first time. Unless it&amp;rsquo;s a profitable sub 20 P/E large cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;Introduction
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a lie to state that there is a lack of capital in Canada. There is plenty of capital in Canada. There are many rich people in Toronto, just look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://condonow.com/One-Bloor-West-Condos&#34;&gt;One Bloor West&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is the lack of guidance and a lack of &lt;em&gt;risk capital&lt;/em&gt; regarding &lt;strong&gt;investment in early-stage startups&lt;/strong&gt;, where ideas here have more merit than the ideas found in the USA (e.g. PearAI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going to a few Ripple Ventures events, I realized there are plenty of startups in Canada, in their own niches, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of people trying to build the next billion dollar company. There is no shortage of companies and talent. However, there is a shortage of hiring at these startups. These startups are usually one man or two man shows, or very bootstrap oriented, thus not having many paid employees, and definitely not highly paid skilled employees. Hiring can increase through capital which can either be saved or raised. Therefore, &amp;ldquo;Build Canada&amp;rdquo; should really be focusing on how to inject more capital into worthwhile lean idea/MVP startups so that they grow and hire people, thus increasing real wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the benefit to founders for raising pre-seed capital is very simple. Raise money → pay employee(s) to work on idea or work fulltime yourself → retain enough equity to &lt;strong&gt;significantly&lt;/strong&gt; increase wealth via equity-compensation rather than cash compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of venture capital is that founders get an immediate network and people will have a reason to hear your startup out, which can easily result to new customers due to the social network and butterfly effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from my notes. Essentially, if you were to work full time, given minimum salary of 40k post-tax, these are the timelines you should have before raising your next round of funding (assuming you live in Toronto and not the suburbs like I do with a massive car expensive LOL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative, which I will call the greedy founder approach, is to raise money, keep your job (as in you have negative opportunity costs), and hire above market government subsidized interns you tech lead for. Based on my calculations, all 4 seed amounts allow for hiring 3 interns per year for 4 months each. Based on the one idea I have, I would pursue the least equity dilution possible. I am sure that within 4 months, an MVP will be made (plus working on the weekend), and so the next 2 interns would be marketing/business development interns who will help get the product in the hands of customers. Business development (sales), is not simple. You&amp;rsquo;d think people with business degrees would know how to do it, but nope. It&amp;rsquo;s really just comes down to drive and inherent advantages some people have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says seed, but I mean healthcare disruption kind of requires having an &amp;ldquo;in.&amp;rdquo; You either get what I mean or you don&amp;rsquo;t. For example, an in would be knowing how something in the status quo works and can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy one is that in Saskatchewan, doctors are forced to use US-based software for patient tracking. A great solution would be a solution that was full-proof encrypted meaning that only members of a group can decrypt the data. That would be a good start and would get widespread adoption as soon as someone high up is convinced to use the software solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried boardy recently speaking on behalf of a friend.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll call you with a real phone number and an AI agent with an voice Australian accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asks you a lot of questions. It tries to mimic human interactions as if its customer service rep for a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just to confirm&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it adds you to their internal network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first recommendation was Yoran from Inovia Capital, which I agree is probably superior than just going to a VC&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second recommendation was Todd Finch. Apparently Boardy searched LinkedIn for him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is not a long-term BUY</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lululemon-is-not-a-long/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 15:30:37 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lululemon-is-not-a-long/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025-06: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a position in LULU, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also placed a limit sell order at ~$385.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally came to this conclusion in September (12th), but it was sitting in my pinned Google Keep for months. The recent sky rocketing of LULU is just another piece of evidence that the market is irrational. The stock was bleeding for months when I decided it might be time to buy but my investing philosophy at the time was &amp;ldquo;is it possible to regret my purchase in 10 years.&amp;rdquo; When I invest in stocks, I value peace of mind over maximizing profits. Of course, one way to do that is to invest for a specific time horizon. The other way, which I am going to start implementing is to do the work to arrive at a sell price. That was the strategy to use when it comes to LULU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compelling reason that existed to buy LULU is because I thought the Chinese will buy their apparel when their economy recovers (I was proven right as the stock skyrocketed recently on International sales). Even so, I still needed a sell price. And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to arrive at the short-term fair price, so heuristics will need to be used (for future stock considerations). Two heuristics I employ are industry P/E (many issues with P/E) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.koyfin.com/share/e31aae25cd&#34;&gt;historic cashflow yield standard deviations&lt;/a&gt; as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/stocks/koyfin_lulu_20241208_040544132.webp&#34; alt=&#34;LULU Cash Flow Yield&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase LULU in September is because &lt;strong&gt;this is not a buy and hold stock&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you go on Instagram, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly realize that LULU does not actually have a moat and many relatively unknown and yet sizable brands, are also using influencer marketing such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/keepthatpump/&#34;&gt;KeepThatPump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dfyne.official/&#34;&gt;dfyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/whitefoxboutique/&#34;&gt;White Fox Boutique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates market saturation and is a red flag to me. This is also why I never bought and do not recommended stocks like Celsius. The good thing about all this research though is that I have a list of luxe-like retailers for the purpose of buying gifts. These companies could make a lot of money if they also started targeting ads at men in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So investing in retail stocks would usually require very high insight into the market so that you can quickly respond to trends. Sorry, that&amp;rsquo;s not me, but the investment funds that manage billions of dollars in assets could easily pay someone to keep track of these trends for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailer stocks include but are not limited to LULU, ANF, CROX, BBW. The problem I have with these stocks isn&amp;rsquo;t their valuation. They could be undervalued, I&amp;rsquo;m just saying that these stocks are better valued by actual professional analysts who have more market trend information on their hand than individual investors who can only really buy using &lt;strong&gt;anecdotal, financial, and/or macro analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Micro-economics is an advantage for being an investment banking analyst, but when it&amp;rsquo;s not a full time job, you need to be aware of [your] bounded rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why DigitalOcean (DOCN) is not a Buy</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 18:35:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it time for me to sell &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOCN/&#34;&gt;$DOCN&lt;/a&gt;? A perspective from a fan and hopefully soon to be ex-shareholder. This is not a bearish take, just a value-portfolio analysis perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34; &gt;Summary
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like DOCN as a company, however I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it&amp;rsquo;s own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34; &gt;What I Used to Think about DOCN
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of ~20 &amp;ldquo;undervalued&amp;rdquo; stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I&amp;rsquo;m up 11% which is better than my benchmark &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MORT/&#34;&gt;$MORT&lt;/a&gt; which has returned 7% during this time. MORT is my benchmark because I was expecting interest rates to be cut and so I expected this ETF to appreciate in value once that happened while paying out* higher than the overnight federal funds rate / risk-free in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they&amp;rsquo;ve done incorrectly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how nice their products are, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how cost effective they are&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don&amp;rsquo;t even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.serverhunter.com&#34;&gt;serverhunter.com&lt;/a&gt;) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. live streaming which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use &amp;ldquo;competitive advantage&amp;rdquo; as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: apparently DigitalOcean VPS&amp;rsquo;s are trash when it comes to performance compared to OvhCloud and Vultr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% at Google (which is a mature &amp;amp; profitable company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that I pay a dollar extra per month on Heroku plus the certificate cost just because I used to host my website on Heroku which dropped the free tier after salesforce acquired the.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Withdraw USD From Deel to Wise Without USD Account Details</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-withdraw-usd-from-deel-to-wise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 13:48:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-withdraw-usd-from-deel-to-wise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So recently, my coworker and I who reside in Canada started getting paid in USD on Deel. One of the ways we could withdraw money is to open a US branch account with one of the big banks (RBC, TD, BMO, etc.), withdraw from Deel, transfer the money to a US dollar account in Canada, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do Norbert&amp;rsquo;s Gambit in a direct investing account bi-weekly, you can pay 200+ basis points of FX fees to convert to CAD. That&amp;rsquo;s assuming the direct investing account even supports DIY Norbert&amp;rsquo;s Gambit (RBC does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about Wise? Well the reason I have to write this article in the first place is because Wise has a join-list for the USD account details. You can still hold USD though. Only when I converted 1 CAD to 1 USD, could I see a US account with a join list for the account details. Wise provided some information that I can accept USD through the GBP account. So that&amp;rsquo;s what we have to do. The comparison section just goes over the expected fees if I used RBC instead of Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fees-napkin-comparisons&#34; &gt;Fees Napkin Comparisons
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fees-napkin-comparisons&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;rbc&#34; &gt;RBC
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rbc&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you only use the freely provided savings accounts, you would pay the minimum of $9.95 (fee per trading order) x 2 = C$19.90 (15 basis points on 10k USD) and 2.27% per currency swap. This is assuming you are extremely fee averse, and that transferring to another Canadian bank is free. Most likely, you will also have a chequing account and avoid the hassle of direct investing, which is at least an additional 30 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wise&#34; &gt;Wise
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wise&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Wise, fees are simply. US$5 per withdrawal due to SWIFT plus at most 28 basis points per conversion from USD to CAD. You can actually do the conversion while sending the money straight to a CAD account. The fees for sending the money to your bank account should be less than C$2.00 (excluding FX fees) regardless of the amount being transferred out of Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-wise-uk-as-a-bank-transfer&#34; &gt;Adding Wise UK as a Bank Transfer
&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Wise, simply open a GBP account, and click on the Global bank details. You&amp;rsquo;ll need this for step 8.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-withdraw-usd-from-deel-to-wise/wise-gbp-account-details.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Wise GBP Account Details&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Deel, click Finance, Withdrawal methods, and then &amp;ldquo;Add method.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Bank transfer. DO NOT CLICK ON &amp;ldquo;Wise&amp;rdquo;, I have tried it before, and it does not work.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-withdraw-usd-from-deel-to-wise/deel-add-bank-transfer.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Deel Add Bank Transfer&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set custom method name to &amp;ldquo;Wise UK - USD&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Country of recipient&amp;rsquo;s bank to &amp;ldquo;United Kingdom.&amp;rdquo; Note I tried to do this using the Canadian account and it did not work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Currency to &amp;ldquo;USD - US Dollar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;SWIFT&amp;rdquo; underneath currency
At this point, the UI should look like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy IBAN and SWIFT from Wise GBP global account. Note that IBAN and Swift appear in the reversed order in comparison to on Wise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Next and add address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deel-withdrawal-process&#34; &gt;Deel WIthdrawal Process

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Deel, click &amp;ldquo;withdraw&amp;rdquo; and select the WIse UK method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait 6 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you get an Email from wise that a deposit was received, you can safely set Wise as the default method for automatic withdrawals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;budgeting&#34; &gt;Budgeting
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#budgeting&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend using a Spreadsheet to budget your spending. Each sheet should be the year, and on the horizontal axis, have each months. On the vertical axis, have gross, taxes (maybe even CPP), and net income. Add expense lines items. After the savings amount, also note which accounts the savings is transferred to. At the end, have a list of liquid net worth based on those accounts. For example: Cash, FHSA, TFSA, RESP, RRSP, High-Risk Investments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealthsimple
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no monthly fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second highest cash interest rate without promotions, tied only with Neo Financial (4% in 2024)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1% cash back on debit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KOHO
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential plan ($4) monthly fee waiver
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure there&amp;rsquo;s a $1,000 deposit every month and you get this plan for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1% cash back on debit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn annual interest rate comparable to CORRA on account balance (5% in 2024)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other plans
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra: $9/month for 1.5% cash back, not really worth it given next section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything: $19/month for 2% cash back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to Wealth Simple today, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to spend the time to get KOHO when I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on keeping much money in the account anyways.
The only thing I cared about was getting away from RBC&amp;rsquo;s $11+ monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credit-card&#34; &gt;Credit Card
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#credit-card&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit card you pick should be based on your spending habits and thus your income. This is because free credit cards are most likely not going to beat Wealth Simple, but which credit card would you want to pay an annual fee for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://creditcardgenius.ca/credit-cards&#34;&gt;Credit Card Genius&lt;/a&gt; takes into account your monthly spending to offer you a good idea of which credit card to purchase. To pay off your credit card, you can setup a pre-authorized debit, or you can e-Transfer from your wealth simple account to the credit card account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, when selecting a credit card, I would choose one where the minimum reward net of annual fees is 1% with additional non-cash benefits. For example, maybe you know you will take 2 round-back trips or 4 flights a year. Therefore, lounge access at Toronto Pearson Airport may be good. I&amp;rsquo;ll would do a quick example of a credit card excluding sign-on bonuses, but honestly, there&amp;rsquo;s so many credit card deals that you should switch credit cards every year until to extract more than 1% in reward benefits. Then when there&amp;rsquo;s no more credit cards, just settle on the one that has the best earning potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Bank&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Points Name&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;37,840&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BMO&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BMO Rewards&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;150&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Transferable as if digital currency&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Debits are at half the conversion rate&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;33,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Scotia&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Scene+&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Not much to spend it on. For example, no flights&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;22,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are to go through credit cards in this preferred liquidation order: AMEX, RBC, BMO, Scotia. Once you go through all of these, just settle on Amex or RBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;domestic-cash-withdrawal---eq-bank&#34; &gt;Domestic Cash Withdrawal - EQ Bank
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#domestic-cash-withdrawal---eq-bank&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATMs have a max daily withdrawal limit of $500/day, so e-transferring from Wealth Simple to EQ Bank and then using the EQ Bank card is pretty good. Lastly, if you need higher cash withdrawals, I recommend joining a credit union such as FirstOntario, Meridian, Vancity, Coast Capital Savings Federal Credit Union. Really shop around though seeing what satisfies your needs. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business&#34; &gt;Business
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#business&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, credit unions might be your best bet. The problem with the big banks are that they eat you up on transaction fees. With credit unions, not only will you encounter a lower monthly fee for good service (e.g. $6/month at RBC versus $5/month at Meridian). The goals of a business account should be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of mobile and web banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digital transactions or waiver of monthly fee equivalent to transactions per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of debt financing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/literary-analysis/flash-boys-a-wall-street-revolt-michael-lewis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 16:05:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/literary-analysis/flash-boys-a-wall-street-revolt-michael-lewis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book was a reading  as part of the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-430&#34;&gt;Financial Market and Securities Trading&lt;/a&gt;. These notes are not just from the book but also contain the context behind the story, for example what the HFTs were doing between Chicago and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes are not organized at the moment, but you should be able to go through them within an hour or so. If you stop at a chapter, bookmark the chapter&amp;rsquo;s permalink (hover mouse over the chapter to see a link icon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flash-boys-chapter-1&#34; &gt;Flash Boys Chapter 1
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#flash-boys-chapter-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Spivey - Spread Networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milliseconds matters (millions of dollars)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting Chicago futures exchange (CME in Aurora) to NASDAQ exchange
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-Mini Futures: smaller than the future price meant for anybody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SP500 E-Mini futures is one of the most frequently traded asset and definitely the most traded futures contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrage: shorting futures contract not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we buy the SPY ETF, but now what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency arbitrage&lt;/strong&gt;: buying the ETF very quickly when the futures contract moves, and sell when the ETF moves
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy at a price between the bid-ask spread, ideally the mid-point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell at a price between the mid-point and the ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t just have to be first to buy, but also be first in the limit sell queue to begin with at every possible price level
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of risks: adverse selection, high capital requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;picking up pennies in front of a steamroller&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When risk is too high, market makers will happily move the spreads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futures contract lead the market and are traded with leverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This arbitrage hurts market makers (adverse selection), therefore, market makers also want to get on the most optimal fiber optic cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market maker has always made money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber optic cable went through mountain which was difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A year later, microwave network was implemented which was faster (30% faster than spread networks), but not available for all 200 firms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government approved spectrum/frequency. Only 15 firms could use this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not many bandwidth in a microwave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave links connect all exchanges nearby (Toronto to CME, European markets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwaves slow down when there is rain. You can collect data from weather stations and see the difference in market quality when there is rain and without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telecommunication companies (Verizon) had no idea the power they had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old fiber optics from Chicago to New Jersey which weren&amp;rsquo;t straight themselves were innovations since they improved from copper wires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2---brads-problem&#34; &gt;Chapter 2 - Brad&amp;rsquo;s Problem
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#chapter-2---brads-problem&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Katsuyama, RBC employee, WLU grad
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC engaged in agency trading, which means executing trades on behalf of clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got sent to Wall Street, NYC at 24 in 2002&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleman between investors to trade large quantities (millions) of shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC, ninth biggest bank in the world at the time, but no name on Wall Street
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not make bad subprime loans to Americans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nor did it peddle subprime mortgage securities to ignorant investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in Canada always say US people are paid too much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that was because RBC is just an afterthought, a nobody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC acquired Carlin for $100M due to being late to changes in the market
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carlin’s CEO Jeremy Frommer was swinging a baseball bat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“They were like, ‘Yeah, I cover [hedge fund giant John] Paulson and we’re tight.’ And you’d call Paulson up and they’d barely heard of the guy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day, an investors wanted to sell 5 million shares after a company had a buy offer for a bit less than $4 a share. The bid and ask quantities were at 1 million. He ended up losing money by selling less than 3.70 as if someone was reading his mind
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever he would enter an order, the liquidity would vanish and he&amp;rsquo;d have to buy at higher prices or sell at lower prices (e.g. 100,000 shares of AMD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Brad first started trading, humans would be processing the orders, but now it was run using a matching engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could trade the same stock on: BATS, Direct Edge, Nasdaq, Nasdaq BX, and etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maker-taker model. Crossing the spread classified the person as a taker who was charged fees and the maker would get paid fees. On BATS (Weehawken, New Jersey) / Secaucus, it was reversed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the hell is Getco (10% of US market at the time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob Park: combined Brad&amp;rsquo;s trading ideas into an algorithm that would buy at a trigger (offer greater than historical average of the amount offered. i.e. a thick market)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden Geese programmers were working on dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HFT would pay to be in the dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash orders: exchange would flash orders to the HFTs before the order hits the books
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York senator Charles Schumer sent a letter to the SEC about this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HFTs know that informed traders would never show that information, so of course those traders are uninformed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was self-selection, the exchange doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would anyone do this? You would flash a marketable order that you think would be serviced by the market providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;former Deutsche Bank software programmer named Billy Zhao, a former manager in Bank of America’s electronic trading division named John Schwall, and a twenty-two-year-old recent Stanford computer science graduate named Dan Aisen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden Geese: Chinese programmer named Allen Zhang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC wanted its own dark pool,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBC is too small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost ($4M) too much to operate the dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When orders went to exchanges one at a time, the market would exist, but when the orders went to all exchange, the orders would disappear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% of BATS. Why? Rob&amp;rsquo;s theory was that time/distance delay was involved. Because BATS was the closest to the office. When they built time delays into the program the orders would reach all exchanges at the same time and be cleared. Someone else was using the differences in time to take front-run. When the HFT firms found that the order filled the entire quote, they basically can connect the dots that someone will be buying from other exchanges as well at that quote. Therefore, front-run the buyer and the buyer experiences slippage.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do the HFT orders come first before the RBC order?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HFTs have shorter fiber optic cables compared to RBC, where the cable lines go around manhattan before they go directly to new jersey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HFTs also had laser links and superior technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misaligned incentives: brokerages paid to send orders to some exchanges and billed for other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Gitlin- managed T. Rowe Price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;, RBCs time delay program, saved $29,000, a tenth of a percent which would be $160M+ daily on the total US stock market volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it bad or good?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front-running itself is illegal and is not what&amp;rsquo;s happening here (back-running)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pension funds could also be the clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front-running: when the brokerage sees an order from a client and buys it and sells it at a higher price. Fiduciary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right word is called &lt;strong&gt;back-running&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;scalping&lt;/strong&gt; but it could just be quote &lt;strong&gt;re-pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is a good thing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offers more liquidity to the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incentivize market makers to lower spreads because the HFTs are taking lowering the adverse selection costs and risks from the market maker because the HFTs are market makers who can immediately acquire the inventory and get rid of it. If the market maker sees someone who is making an informed decision, then they wil want to pre-acquire the inventory and reduce their inventory costs. Therefore, the bid-ask spread will be lower than otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to my course, this story is partially true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3---ronans-platform&#34; &gt;Chapter 3 - Ronan&amp;rsquo;s Platform

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;43 milliseconds to 3.8 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges soon caught on but Ronan was the expert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching time went from 150 &lt;em&gt;microseconds&lt;/em&gt; to 1.2 microseconds per trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HFT firms did not want anyone knowing how much they made nor what they were really up to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HFT Firms: Hudson River Trading, Eagle Seven, Simplex Investments, Evolution Financial Technologies, Cooperfund, DRW&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HFT traders posted buy and sell orders of 100-shares on every stock on BATS not because they wanted to buy or sell them, but because they wanted to gain insight into what investors wanted to buy or sell. BATS was created by HFTs, hence the incentive to send orders to BATS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency tables: time to travel from each brokerage to each exchange
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables HFT to discern the broker of the trade, and thus whether the shares are part of a much larger order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the Digital Broker works
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algorithm: how to divide up the quantity and when to send the orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Router: where to send the order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers pay commissions to get routed through dark pool, then exchanges that pay the broker, then the other exchanges (cost effective route)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CBSX exchange in Chicago suburbs inverted pricing structure to charge makers and pay takers which was coincident with Spread Networks opening recently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ronan was involved with Spread Networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge percentage of trades sent to dark pool get executed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does co-location matter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction-to-thinking-fast-and-slow&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A book about biases of intuition and how to create diagnoses and labels just like doctors have/do for illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos Tversky was one of the first in decision making research. Kahneman asked him in 1959 to speak at a seminar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question was proposed. Whether humans are intuitive statisticians just like we are intuitive grammarians. The question lead to a survey proposal to figure out if researchers collect too few observations than necessary to draw conclusions, which lead to the conclusion that statisticians themselves are not intuitive and are not able to properly state how likely a result is to reproduce in a smaller sample. The goal was to judge the intuitive answers and not the actual answers to the statistical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-steve-problem&#34; &gt;The Steve Problem
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-steve-problem&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can describe Steve as a person who resembles the &amp;ldquo;stereotypical&amp;rdquo; librarian and ask if Steve is more likely to be a librarian or a farmer. Most people choose librarian even though the ratio of male farmers to male librarians are 20:1. Personally, I did not fall for this trick because the stereotype that librarians are shy is not true, they are very outgoing and are the first to say hello to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-resemblance-heuristic&#34; &gt;The Resemblance Heuristic
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-resemblance-heuristic&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous study highlights the resemblance rule of thumb that people make use of when asked with a difficult problem which leads to predictable biases. The takeaway here is to be aware of when we are employing this heuristic as to not make important decisions from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ease-of-memory-search&#34; &gt;Ease of Memory Search
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ease-of-memory-search&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two questions. One is questioning rate of divorce among professors which triggers searching for people trying to recall whether they know of such a situation. A more formal question is &amp;ldquo;Is the letter K more likely to appear in words of a text at the start or at the third position.&amp;rdquo; I personally think the third position as I could only think of a handful of words that start with K that are used often versus the word &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; which is even in the sentence! As I read further on, I am vindicated. I&amp;rsquo;m happy the book has been rubbing off on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias of the answers is that people are mostly thinking of words starting with the letter K than when K is in third position, so they will exaggerate the frequency of K being in the first position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;availability-heuristic&#34; &gt;Availability Heuristic
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#availability-heuristic&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When information pertaining to one situation is shown/presented more often than information pertaining to another, it is easy to place a higher probability on the former situation. The example in the book is that the author challenged his long-standing impression that politicians cheated more often than physicians and lawyers but it turned out his impression was just that and could be due to the choices of journalists. This is a very good topic that Noam Chomsky talks about in his books Manufacturing Consent, Media Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heuristic also applies to what issues the public is vocal about and silent about. For example, vocal about housing crisis, not vocal about male circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A remarkable feat of intuition, a fire fighter commander yelled to people to get out after they put out a kitchen fire as his ears were hot and fire was quiet so he could tell something was wrong. The floor collapsed soon after the fire fighters got out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After studying chess master, Herbert Simon determined that the master saw the pieces differently after hours of practice since they could draw on information stored in memory rather than having to think and ponder over a position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel is drawn to how we are not surprised when a two-year old points to a dog with glee and says &amp;ldquo;doggie!.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-all-expert-intuitions-are-the-same&#34; &gt;Not all Expert Intuitions are the Same
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-all-expert-intuitions-are-the-same&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a stark difference between someone making a decision based on hours of experience and the example in the textbook of a chief investment officer buying shares in Ford because he was impressed at an automobile show he attended. A gut feeling is not the same as expert intuition, although a gut feeling that can be explained via hard facts like &amp;ldquo;hot ear&amp;rdquo; is different than the gut feeling based on feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion by the author is that emotion plays a big role in intuition and the stock picker is an example of the Affect Heuristic; guided by feelings of like and dislike with little to no reasoning/deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intuitive-heuristics&#34; &gt;Intuitive Heuristics
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#intuitive-heuristics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When faced with a difficult question that cannot be answered with intuition based on relevant experience, a similar and  easier question is answered in substitute. When spontaneous thinking fails, slower thinking starts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years of investigating biases, they published an article on  20 or so heuristics/biases in the Science magazine. The article challenges the broadly held belief that humans are generally rational with normally sound thinking except when it comes to certain emotions (fear, affection, hatred).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1---characters-in-the-story&#34; &gt;Chapter 1 - Characters in the Story
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#chapter-1---characters-in-the-story&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighted difference between how easy it was to identify a woman&amp;rsquo;s mood based on a glance of the image versus a multiplication problem 17 x 24, which most people are not tuned to answer using intuitive thinking. When doing the problem mentally, we keep the intermediate results in our brain, while our body is strained, and our eys focused. The answer of 408 finally comes after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 1: operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 2: allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Some examples of System 1 are provided&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect that one object is more distant than another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orient to the source of a sudden sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the phrase “bread and…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a “disgust face” when shown a horrible picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect hostility in a voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer to 2 + 2 = ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read words on large billboards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive a car on an empty road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a strong move in chess (if you are a chess master).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand simple sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail” resembles an occupational stereotype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;System 2 operations share a common feature of attention and being disrupted when attention is drawn away&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brace for the starter gun in a race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus attention on the clowns in the circus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check the validity of a complex logical argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of system 2 thinking falters when attention is taken away. Therefore, multi-tasking can only really work when there are no System 2 tasks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another takeaway is that when driving in an area that is of higher stress, a passenger can easily lower the performance of the driver. Example of the video of the invisible gorilla was given, where the conclusion is that not only can we be blind to what we ought to have seen, we are also blind to the fact that we are blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 1 is running automatically, and system 2 is in low-effort mode. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. System 2 endorses the directive of system 1, these into beliefs or voluntary actions with little modifications. Whereas if System 1 fails, it calls on System 2. System 1 is basically surprised by an event that it determines not to fit in its model. System 2 is also used for continuous monitoring (e.g. polite when angry), and mobilizes when an error is about to occur. The &amp;ldquo;division of labour&amp;rdquo; between these systems leads to minimizing effort and maximizing performance. System 1 has biases though and the system cannot be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous section I read was very good as it made me think of architecture designs when it comes to autonomous artificial intelligence as well as computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing an autonomous agent, we probably want it to also have these two systems. We might want to develop two different networks, somewhat connected, where the first network takes in input and tries to quickly generate something, which is then fed into a second system specialized in correctness, and then a third system depending on if the second system took displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing a chip, since most tasks are system 1 thinking, we want to pack as many efficient cores as possible that focus on minimizing energy usage and maximizing common tasks. For example, a computer is going to be used for two tasks most of the time: browsing the internet (network I/O), some sort of app that makes uses storage (productivity apps). Of course, a computer can also be designed knowing it will be used for a niche tasks more often than the others (e.g. gaming CPUs). So when mass producing these CPUs, 80% will be E cores, while maybe 20% will be performance. The 80-20 rule comes in handy a lot, but it too is a bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we need to also determine what is the ideal number of cores and that comes down to total ideal energy usage as well as costs. Industry standard is 8 cores for mobile max, but I think 10 cores would be a game changer as two more E-cores can be added while maintaining 2 P-cores.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section starts by highlighting the difference in our efficiency when we are told to do a task where the contents the task pertains to have related or opposite meaning. The example tasks was read a column of words and whispering the casing of the words. The efficiency is lower when the words themselves are the words that could bew whispered. So when reading upper, you whisper lower, and when reading LOWER you whisper upper. Conclusion: system 2 is in charge of self control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horizontal lines are in fact equal but you should&amp;rsquo;ve seen this illusion or some form of it enough time by the time you are 22 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we know that the lengths are equal, we still see that the bottom is longer, and this is system 1 at work. Although we can teach ourselves to ignore line length comparison when fins are attached, we cannot override system 1 thinking, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem that AI can be fed a lot of system 2 thinking without hindering what I call the system 1 thinking. So our own perception of what system 1 cannot overcome, can definitely be overcome by AI in a similar response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Illusions. Apparently the professor of psychology at one of the lectures the author attended said therapists will meet a patient who claims this time will be different and how previous therapists have failed him and the professor says this person is most likely a psychopath so to skip them; Psychopathic charm. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it though. As a therapist, can&amp;rsquo;t you just use a psychopath for research then? Do moral psychopaths not exist? Plus you get paid anyways. Also some patients probably are hard on themselves and exaggerate the inefficacy of therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tedious effort, we should aim to learn to recognize when mistakes are more likely to be made and avoid significant mistakes in serious situations, as I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Add-1 Task is to select random string of 4 digits and read out the digits with +1 added to each digit. So a 9 would become a 0. The person should wait for 2 beats of a metronome (I think they are supposed to hit the desk with their hand themselves) before reading it out. For better demonstration of system 2, the challenge can be made into Add-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dilated-pupils&#34; &gt;Dilated Pupils
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dilated-pupils&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dilated pupil can be interpreted as someone being interested. Whether in what they are looking at or in glee for the information they have processed. Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort. There is distinction between dilated pupils from mental effort and emotional effort. My girlfriend definitely recalled once when I was programming during a video call with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson Beatty and Kahneman decided to do a test where participants would be asked questions and they would answer while pictures of their eye would be taken using an infrared camera on every beat of a metronome. The task of Add-1 was given where participants would speak each digit one by one, allowing the cameras to capture correlations of dilation with respect to many factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add-1 with four digits caused a larger dilation than the task of holding seven digits for immediate recall. Add-3, which is much more difficult, is the most demanding that I ever observed. In the first 5 seconds, the pupil dilates by about 50% of its original area and heart rate increases by about 7 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tasks become much harder, the pupils shrank or stop dilating. Therefore maximum dilation also means maximum tolerable difficulty, which if breached will lead to giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After witnessing the pupils under a mundane conversation, where the pupils did not dilate, the conclusion drawn was that System 2 usually works at &amp;ldquo;the pace of a comfortable walk&amp;rdquo; and is sometimes interrupted by jogs/sprints. Priority to other tasks decreases as mental energy increases and so blindness also is coincident with mental strain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people are more skilled at tasks, less energy is require and this is a symptom of laziness being built into us. Effort is a cost so if we want to lower it, we acquire skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortex associated with intelligence. Additionally, context switching is effortful. Ability to control attention is not just for general intelligence signals but performance in careers such as air traffic controller or air force pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time pressure makes the mind work uncomfortably hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We avoid mental overloading by committing intermediate memory into long-term memory or paper rather than overloading the working memory. Therefore, one might say to get better at writing/typing, but we can take it a step further that we can study the biological ways to expand the working memory as well as determining at what point a CPU cache is too big.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi studied the state of effortless attending, &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt;. Concentration so deep that you lose sense of time. I have attained this flow myself several times. The last time where I achieved flow was a week ago. It was Friday and I was working. Three hours or more went by just like that. A recent but more memorable example is the C# console application template I made. The purpose of the project is irrelevant, but it was definitely something that required no self-control and one that did require me expending energy. I was unable to simply pause the project, I was determined to make it work just the way I wanted it to work before I went to sleep. When there is no effort required in self-control, resources are free to be expensed on the task at hand. The question I have is did the task muster the flow or is flow a perk of some sort that improves the performance at the task?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When System 2 is &lt;em&gt;cognitively busy&lt;/em&gt;, system 1 has more influence and so you can be swayed more easily and make choices that are easier (e.g. selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments). Being cognitively busy is not the sole cause of these actions though, alcohol and sleep deprivation can have an affect too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego depletion is when you are using effort on self-control so are unable to take on other challenges. Sounds a lot like what recovering addicts go through. &amp;ldquo;When there is ego-depletion, people succumb more quickly to the urge to quit.&amp;rdquo; One study was how physical stamina of a handgrip task would be less while the participant was told to inhibiting emotions and another study was about how resisting the temptation of chocolate cake by eating virtuous fruits would later lead to giving up earlier than normal when faced with a difficult cognitive task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;A sample list of tasks&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding the thought of white bears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inhibiting the emotional response to a stirring film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making a series of choices that involve conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to impress others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;responding kindly to a partner’s bad behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interacting with a person of a different race (for prejudiced individuals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Sample indicators of depletion&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deviating from one’s diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overspending on impulsive purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reacting aggressively to provocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;persisting less time in a handgrip task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performing poorly in cognitive tasks and logical decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego depletion is not the same mental state as cognitive busyness, and so the incentives have to become stronger to overcome the depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood glucose is the fuel of mental activity, and effortful mental activity corresponds to a higher gear and thus more fuel consumption. So what is the best way to restore glucose while trying to reduce weight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Favourite fruits&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mangoes (Indian)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berries (Blackberries, Raspberries)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiwi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomegranate (when it&amp;rsquo;s just right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange* (real good oranges, not clementines, satsumas, or Tangerine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that after being ego-depleted by a task (watch this, ignore that), drinkers of lemonade with sugar were not depleted anymore compared to the drinkers of lemonade with Splenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbing consequences: It was found that for parole judges in Israel, although the default decision is denial, with 35% approval rating, the proportion spikes after each meal, when about 65% of requests are granted. The approval rating drops to zero just before the next meal. What can we do? The default should be approval, and the judges have to write reasons to disapprove. Of course that means more criminals are on parole, but the point of the justice system is rehabilitation and reintegration, not punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bat and ball costs $1.10. The bat is $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people that just rely on intuition, will answer 10 cents, but the answer is 5 cents after working through it. When we answer the question with 10 cents, our system 2 would rather approve system 1 thinking that invest the small effort in double checking the answer. At renowned universities (Harvard, MIT, Princeton), 50+ % of students gave the wrong answers however at all the other universities, it was in 80+ %. The law of least effort is at work and many do not have active minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Grade 12 philosophy, we did some exercises on logic. In this book we are asked to determine if this argument is sound as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All roses are flowers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some flowers fade quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore some roses fade quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I determined it was wrong because I re-read the first sentence to ensure I interpreted it properly. When I first read this, I made the relationship that flowers are the subset of roses, but when reading the third statement, I re-read the first statement to ensure that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the other way around and it was the other way around so I knew the argument was not sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment has discouraging implications for reasoning in everyday life. It suggests that when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this premise follows the conclusion reasoning can be applied elsewhere. &lt;strong&gt;*cough* *cough*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funny question asked was to guess the number of murders in Michigan which resulted in lower guesses than people asked about murders in Detroit, because people do not think about Detroit when they are told about Michigan. I don&amp;rsquo;t even live in the USA. I didn&amp;rsquo;t/don&amp;rsquo;t even know if Detroit has a murder problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny the book mentions this, when I wrote about these sins just yesterday. However I called sloth lethargy, but clearly sloth is used for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people were ranked by their self-control and by their cognitive aptitude, would individuals have similar positions in the two rankings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment was one where four-year olds would be subject to staring at an Oreo and a bell for 15 minutes (nothing else in the room). They were told beforehand that if they waited for 15 minutes, they could get another oreo. However, they could at any time ring the bell and eat the oreo. The study found that those with self-control went on to have higher scores on intelligence tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study found that a game that trained attention (move the cat to the grassy area by avoiding the muddy areas), improved executive control as well as nonverbal tests of intelligence that was maintained for several months. Reminds me of that un-natural spatial IQ deficiency between women and men which is a result of differences in how they are raised but can be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study by the same group, identified specific genes involved in control of attention, showed that parenting techniques also affected this ability, and demonstrated a close connection between the children’s ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shane Frederick decided to study people who failed these anti-intuitive questions (including the bat and the ball),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;The other two questions&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 minutes OR 5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad and I call these types of problems, &lt;em&gt;manhours&lt;/em&gt;. A harder version of these problems would focus on building. This question is stupidly easy in my opinion. 5 minutes for each machine to make 1 widget, so clearly, it takes 5 minutes for 100 machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 days OR 47 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary answers make the question much easier to answer. The question even says &amp;ldquo;doubles in size.&amp;rdquo; I wonder what people would answer if the question was flipped (47 days to cover half the lake, 94 or 48 days to cover the entire lake).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prone to answer questions with the first idea that comes to mind and unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These show up else where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;63% prefer to get $3,400 this month rather than next month compared to 37% of people who solved all 3 questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIlling pay twice as much as solvers for overnight delivery of books that were ordered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System 1 is impulsive. So when about to make an impulsive decision, keep track until system 2 naturally disagrees more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Stanovich and Richard West are credited with System 1 and System 2 introduction, although they call it Type 1 an Type 2 processes. They stress that rationality and intelligence are separate as rationality prevent the biases whereas intelligence tests have not incorporated jumpy thinking (my words).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book tries to gaslight you into thinking when you are shown &lt;em&gt;Bananas Vomit&lt;/em&gt; that you will instinctively be disgusted and have a &amp;ldquo;temporary aversion&amp;rdquo; to both bananas and the book. When I saw the words, I was just confused because who puts those two words together. Incoherence was my first thought. Maybe I do not have much disgusting vomit memories to recall or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that I am looking forward to eating dinner. You see, I have to read 5+ chapters of this book today to catch up for my class and for today&amp;rsquo;s reading (Chapter 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny I call it incoherent because as I read on, the book talks about &lt;em&gt;associatively coherent&lt;/em&gt;; where your cognitive, emotional, and physical responses are diverse but in sync (he calls it integrated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the psychologists perspective: each idea is a node that is linked to many others. Links can be causes, properties, categories. When people think of ideas, it is like an area blast, where many ideas are activated at once, but only few render to consciousness. I think of it like a video game where a grenade exploded, but clearly, the blast centre is significantly easier to notice than the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know far less about ourselves than we feel we do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;priming-effect&#34; &gt;Priming Effect
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#priming-effect&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we encounter words (or ideas), we are primed to think of the related ideas when faced with the next input. For example I&amp;rsquo;m hungry. What letter goes here: SO_P? Did you say SOUP? What if I said I plan on going to shower soon. Maybe SOAP? Khaneman says that the initial idea/word of EAT or WASH primes us to prefer one mental path over another. Psychological research pertaining to mapping these ripples is an exciting pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to priming than concepts and words. Actions and emotion can be primed by events that you are unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Florida effect study done by John Bargh, students were asked to come up with sentences from a set of five words and the students who assembled sentences related to the elderly {Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle}  walked slower in the task of being told to walk to another room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideomotor effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;none of the students reported noticing that the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words they had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal priming also exists where walking slow leads to recognizing words related to old age!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book there is an interesting example of how people can be made to smile subconsciously by telling them to put a pencil in their teeth so that the eraser is facing the left and the point faces the right. This smiling is also associated with finding things funnier although the participant would not notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habitual connections is all it takes. Heading nodding up and down can translate to being more agreeable. This applies even to voting when a vote occurring in a school makes voters partial towards school motions as well as if images are shown. Images have a greater effect than being a parent versus a non-parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can even prime people to be money-primed and the effect will be significant enough to be noticeable. From being more selfish to prefer being more independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*cough* *cough*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and we have no conscious access to them, even if these priming examples lead to percents in changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funny example of priming is an honesty box where there was a banner close by with either eyes or flowers and the money given per litre of milk consumed moved significantly. It goes to show you that we can make people behave more ethical not be actually violating people&amp;rsquo;s privacy, but my priming them with the idea that they are not in the clear to act unethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can apparently prime people to be critical, so this can even translate into software development where people review PRs. We could possibly prime the reviewer by tinkering with the review interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Ease is measured from a range of easy to strained where easy indicate well going (no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention) and strained indicates a problem exists. This is &lt;em&gt;cognitive strain&lt;/em&gt; and it includes the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recency bias but for words combined with cognitive ease can make those words or concepts hold greater value just because of recognition rather than fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. It is most applicable when not remembering the source of the fact but the familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have always offered peace. They have always rejected peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the intuitive question study, the study also found out that student performance was better when the font was worse than when the font was good. Is this is a signal to publish important information is media that is hard to focus on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently cognitive ease makes the words feel more related to each other. Mood plays a big role in intuitive accuracy. The words themselves can invoke emotions that lead to coherence.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system 1 personal model is constructed by associations that link ideas of circumstances, events, actions, and outcomes that co-occur with some regularity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are events that happen that you don&amp;rsquo;t expect to happen and are not surprised when they do occur. Normal situational, but not probable enough to be actively expected. I guess a phone call would fit in here? All it takes is one incident to no longer be surprised. Anecdotes are given in the text of running into an acquittance on a vacation and then two week later somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many animals did Moses take into the arc? It was Noah not Moses. The moses illusion! I disagree though since this is a poor example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain activity has a distinct pattern when it encounters words that are odd. When someone says a normal table, we know generally how it is, but we can&amp;rsquo;t give a specific definition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fred’s parents arrived late. The caterers were expected soon. Fred was angry.” We know that Fred is angry because of the parents arrived late and not because the caterers were expected soon. We know the link between punctuality and possibly anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example is when Saddam Hussein was captured, bond prices went up and then down but for both Bloomberg&amp;rsquo;s headline was that the capture lead to US treasuries being up and to them being down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement that can explain two contradictory outcomes explains nothing at all. In fact, all the headlines do is satisfy our need for coherence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Limited information lets System 1 find a coherent casual story to link the fragments of knowledge at its disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgian psychologist Albert Michotte argued in 1945 that we see causality not that we infer physical causality from repeated observations of correlations among events. An example of a 2D black square moving into another black square and that black square &amp;ldquo;starts moving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are prone to apply casual thinking inappropriately, to situations that require statistical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping to conclusions: efficient when likely to be correct and occasional mistakes are tolerable. Risky when when the situation is unfamiliar, and the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example provided to the reader that illustrates jumping to conclusion is hand drawn ABC but the vertical step of the B is spaced meaning that it could&amp;rsquo;ve been interpreted as A13C, On the right side is 12 13 14 but the 13 is drawn similarly to the B. The middle picture is a sentence using bank, but it could&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about a river bank. This example illustrated the point that jumping to conclusions can be simple and when it happens we never register that there was ambiguity to begin with. Daniel Gilbert, author of &lt;em&gt;Stumbling to Happiness&lt;/em&gt; conducted a study on non-sense false sentence that participants had a hard to &amp;ldquo;unbelieve&amp;rdquo; when the sentence was shown while their system 2 was pre-occupied with another task (holding digits in working memory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;positive test strategy: the process in which system 2 tests a hypothesis by looking for examples that fit the narrative unlike scientists who try to refute the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;halo-effect&#34; &gt;Halo Effect
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#halo-effect&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underused term that describes common biases perfectly.
The halo effect gives credibility where evidence is lacking or favourability over another due to the order facts are encountered. The halo effect suppresses ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these words possible to describe a single person? intelligent—industrious—impulsive—critical—stubborn—envious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that if we split the last three words to describe someone else, people believe it&amp;rsquo;s impossible that all six can be attributed to a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group estimates work best when each person makes an estimate individually and is not influenced by others in the group as the biases average out. Witnesses to an event should not be allowed to discuss it with each other before testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application to corporate executives: when having meetings discussing an issue, each person should be write a summary of their position which results in valuing the groups diverse knowledge rather than dealing with differences in how loud and often people talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat jumping to conclusions (What you see is all there is or WYSIATI), we may need to work backwards. So when asking if X is Y based on Z, we start by defining what it means to be Y and then assess if Z addresses all of what it means to be Y. Questions like is Mark an ethical person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who hear one side of the story will almost always have higher convictions of their judgement that those who hear both sides to a story / legal case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overconfidence: can&amp;rsquo;t tell if the evidence is missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;framing effect: how you structure a sentence leads to different reactions and thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;base-rate neglect: ignoring what the real world probability is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;System 1 continuously monitors the situation and gives basic assessments, which can form intuitive judgement. Substitutions of judgement is allowed. Translating values across dimensions (how tall would Sam be if they were as tall as their intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any intension of system 2 to answer a question triggers system 1 again. Situations are constantly evaluated as good or bad, requiring escape or permitting approach. We have the ability to judge people as safe or dangerous off a single glance. It influences how people vote. Ratings of competence rather than likability are the predictors of voting choices, albeit it can only explain 70% of results. Competence is a combination of strength and trustworthiness. Strong chin, slight confident smile,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people were asked how much they would contribute to help out birds that would otherwise drown, the number of birds to help didn&amp;rsquo;t matter because the groups still averaged the same amount of money. &amp;ldquo;The almost complete neglect of quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times.&amp;rdquo; Is it the neglect of emotional contexts, or does emotional contexts translate to a price for people and people would still answer with the max amount of money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental shotgun is the inability of system 2 to direct system 1 to one train of thoughts. System 1 will always do more than just what is required of it. An example is asking someone who hates big tech if the companies in big tech are financially well off. Or better yet, asking someone who likes a product if the company is doing well (when the company is not in fact doing well such as Peloton).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#chapter-9---answering-an-easier-question&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target question is the assessment you intend to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heuristic question is the simpler question that you answer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target question is the assessment you intend to produce. The heuristic question is the simpler question that you answer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitution and heuristics in this sense stems from the mental shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;What is the meaning of happiness?&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equivalent heuristic is &amp;ldquo;what makes me happy right now&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of happiness is two-parts. The first part is of positive events and milestones. The second part is the minimization of being harmed, whether that be emotionally, physically, or even physiologically (e.g. shelter, food, people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rdquo; types of questions, intensity matching is the process of converting the answer of a heuristic into an answer for the original question. If both things have a scale, then we can easily translate in our heads using System 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/thinking-fast-and-slow/three-men.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Three men in a corridor&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Is the figure on the right larger than the figure on the left?&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful illusion. There is no larger man. The 3D interpretation screws with our heads. We are tricked because we are thinking about the actual size of the people and not of the drawing. The bias is very deep, although the figure on the right is drawn in a peculiar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the happiness question when asked about happiness and more, the order matters. If a question that could be a heuristic for happiness is asked first, it severely influences the happiness question. The example is asking about dating life and then happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Characteristic of System 1&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguishes the surprising from the normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infers and invents causes and intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is biased to believe and confirm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generates a limited set of basic assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computes more than intended (mental shotgun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overweights low probabilities*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-10---the-law-of-small-numbers&#34; &gt;Chapter 10 - The Law of Small Numbers
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#chapter-10---the-law-of-small-numbers&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of this chapter is a play on words. The law of large numbers does not actually apply to small numbers, although intuitions believe so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the counties with the lowest and highest rates of kidney cancer rural? Rural life can&amp;rsquo;t explain both but being presented with one of these will make you use the rural life as an explanation of the statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are statistical facts so the actual possibility could simply be that there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough of a sample size to draw a solid conclusion. When population is smaller, the variability of any observation rate is high and cannot be taken as mere forward thinking fact. Ergo randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation can be done with marbles. Imagine there&amp;rsquo;s a pool of marbles of two different colours and two people sampling different sizes. The person sampling a smaller size is more likely to hit a homogenous sample than the person drawing more marbles. So if red marbles are kidney cancer and white marbles are not kidney cancer, then the person drawing smaller samples (for each county) is going to be hitting both all no cancers and all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts: results entirely produced by the method of research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;psychologists commonly chose samples so small that they exposed themselves to a 50% risk of failing to confirm their true hypotheses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this even though a sample size can be computed from the acceptable risk of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when we discuss polls, people are not sensitive to the sample size!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a general bias that favour certainty over doubt which requires the hard work of sustaining doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

Are all three of these sequences likely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BGBBGB
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already knew about this sort of bias somewhere before, so I said yes they are equally likely, because true randomness does not look as intuitive as we&amp;rsquo;d expect. The intuitive answer is that the third one is the most likely, but this is faulty logic, since each of the three sequences is a probability of 0.5^6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random. Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gates Foundation invested money to find out the characteristics of the most successful schools. One of the conclusions of this research is that the most successful schools, on average, are small. In a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania, for instance, 6 of the top 50 were small, which is an over-representation by a factor of 4..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on this finding based on what we discussed at the start of the chapter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came to my mind due to what was mentioned earlier was that the schools were small because of the inherent variability in smaller schools similar to rural counties. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised the book thinks that the readers have not learned how to recognize the bias yet. It turns out that even the worst schools were smaller so all these foundations investing in smaller schools might have backfired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways of the chapter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is easy to pay more attention to the result than the reliability of the data used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how certain are we the results are not chance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when drawing conclusions of good, we should also look at the conclusion of bad. To do good is also to avoid doing bad. (I added this)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anchoring index is simply the ratio of the two differences (562/1,020) expressed as a percentage: 55%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Estate agents will deny that the asking price influenced their decision of what the lowest price they would accept would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asking for donations from people sensitive to the cause, even an extravagant number ($400) can lead to higher average donations ($143) compared to the average of $64 without an anchor, and an average of $20 with a low anchor ($5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rationing of campbell soup led to more soup purchased&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice when encountering a ridiculous offer is to make a sene and leave rather than make an equally ridiculous offer which will hinder further negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve negotiations, think about lowest price that the opponent would accept as well as what the cost of losing out is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe due to anchoring effect, penalties should be capped based on the defendant&amp;rsquo;s cash position? e.g. (10% of Retained Earnings, 10% of net tangible value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in other joint projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to rate assertiveness after listing six versus twelve examples, assertiveness rating is lower with more examples listed. This applies to lack of assertiveness (the more examples of lack of assertiveness asked, the more assertive the person rated themselves). The effect is not present if the participants are told beforehand that there is a reason for the diminished recalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims and near victims are very concerned after a disaster. After each significant earthquake, Californians are for a while diligent in purchasing insurance and adopting measures of protection and mitigation&amp;hellip;However, the memories of the disaster dim over time, and so do worry and diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protective actions as done by individuals and governments are designed by tracking only the worst disaster experienced, assuming that future disasters could be no worse. It is hard to think that way though. This is a very good takeaway. We need to reassess some of our protective actions, especially for climate change, based on what could go wrong, not based on what has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strokes cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents combined, but 80% of respondents judged accidental death to be more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tornadoes were seen as more frequent killers than asthma, although the latter cause 20 times more deaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death by lightning was judged less likely than death from botulism even though it is 52 times more frequent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death by disease is 18 times as likely as accidental death, but the two were judged about equally likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death by accidents was judged to be more than 300 times more likely than death by diabetes, but the true ratio is 1:4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;affect heuristic&lt;/em&gt;: using how do I feel about it to answer what to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heuristic makes the world seem more ordered than it is in reality. When people hear about benefits, they automatically think there is less risk (vice versa as well). In the real world, trade-offs do exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul Slovic, evaluation of risk depends on the measure itself (death per million, death per millions of dollars of product produced). “defining risk is thus an exercise in power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cass Sunstein takes another stance which is that the existing USA regulations are about public perception and not rationality. He argues that we should focus on saving life-years, not even just life. By looking at life-years, we would focus on younger people more. Insert: this was a very important distinction, as I viewed adults and children as equal life before I read this. I still dislike when media, including government statements always include that women are affected even when men are affected more (e.g. homelessness in Canada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;availability cascade&lt;/em&gt;: biases flow into policy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped along deliberately by “availability entrepreneurs,” individuals or organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news&amp;hellip;.anyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of association with a “heinous cover-up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Book examples: Love Canal affair and the so-called Alar scare
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love Canal, buried toxic waste was exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing contamination of the water well beyond standard limits, as well as a foul smell.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The legislation that mandated the cleanup of toxic sites, called CERCLA, established a Superfund and is considered a significant achievement of environmental legislation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alar is a chemical that was sprayed on apples to regulate their growth and improve their appearance. 1989
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;when consumed in gigantic doses, caused cancerous tumors in rats and mice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The manufacturer withdrew the product and the FDA banned it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subsequent research deemed very small risk of a carcinogen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fewer good apples were consumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible for the Canadian Cabinet to have non-MP members, and apparently even the majority, although its very unusual for the non MPs to not seek and win election.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter is about how dubious information still spoils rational thinking and that the imperfect choices made are due to System 2 laziness and not ignorance, meaning that if we keep System 2 engaged or ignore dubious information, we can think straight. The problem I have is that most of the time, the information isn&amp;rsquo;t dubious but rather arbitrary and the conclusions others have made due to quick thinking. How can we invoke other people to re-evaluate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the base rate is obvious when no other information is provided.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a personality is given even when it should not be trusted, people will forego the base rates and rank the field of study according to stereotypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stereotypes - judging via representativeness - can sometimes be true but also false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive willingness to predict low base-rate events
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with PhDs are more likely to subscribe to The New York Times than people with only a high school diploma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is reading The New York Times, what is a better bet? That they have a PhD or that they do not have a college degree? The  latter of course, since implications do not imply the vice versa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instructing people to “think like a statistician” enhanced the use of base-rate information, while the instruction to “think like a clinician” had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method of improving predictive accuracy is to engage System 2 (e.g. via frowning)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, System 2 was failing due to laziness and not due to ignorance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals need to invest special effort to properly conduct analysis, it makes sense why comment sections are often filled with spam and ignorance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one thing you can do when you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your judgments of probability stay close to the base rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you believe in an event, you need to confirm that the resulting logical probabilities (i.e. Bayesian statistics) are also what you believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you believe that there is a 30% chance that candidate X will be elected president, and an 80% chance that he will be reelected if he wins the first time, then you must believe that the chances that he will be elected twice in a row are 24%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give high credence to the plausible base rate even with provided evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question how applicable the evidence is (assurance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book mentions how to watch out for representativeness, but I re-arrange some examples for the beneficiary of the underdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if a company/individual has a highly core competency, you need to present yourself well: well-trimmed lawn, competent looking receptionist, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare event predictions due to weak evidence, but what is weak evidence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A damning report, but how sure that the evidence is solid (e.g. Bear reports on certain stocks)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is a teacher in elementary school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is active in the feminist movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is a psychiatric social worker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is a bank teller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is an insurance salesperson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sets up a contradiction to the intuition that Linda is part of the feminist and a bank teller compared to just being a bank teller. “feminist bank teller” ranked higher than “bank teller” in both. Representativeness wins against logic even when asking Statistics doctoral students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem was shortened to just &amp;ldquo;bank teller&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;bank teller and active in the feminist movement&amp;rdquo; and people still answered with the second choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;John List economist experimented with baseball cards. When auctioning sets of ten high-value cards, versus sets where three modest cards were added, the larger set is valued less in &lt;em&gt;single evaluation&lt;/em&gt;: where the group is shown only one of the sets than in &lt;em&gt;joint valuation&lt;/em&gt;: where the observers can see both sets and then place a value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking about hard numbers rather than percentages, reduces the error seen (65% to 25%). This is usually due to &amp;ldquo;frequency representation&amp;rdquo; which appreciates that one group is wholly included in the other. &lt;strong&gt;Forcing people think of individuals improves rationality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Health Survey Problem&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health survey was conducted in a sample of adult males in British Columbia, of all ages and occupations. Please give your best estimate of the following values: What percentage of the men surveyed have had one or more heart attacks?
What percentage of the men surveyed are both over 55 years old and have had one or more heart attacks? (65% fail)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health survey was conducted in a sample of 100 adult males in BC, of all ages and occupations. Please give your best estimate of the following values: How many of the 100 participants have had one or more heart attacks? How many of the 100 participants both are over 55 years old and have had one or more heart attacks? (25% fail)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, try not to communicate in a way where probability is taken as plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical base rates are underweighted, but if you apply causality to them, it can be easily combined with the information in an individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night.
Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
You are given the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implication: &lt;strong&gt;85% of accidents involve green cabs&lt;/strong&gt; (causal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our brain is tempted to write off the initial statistic, we need to apply &lt;em&gt;Bayesian inference&lt;/em&gt; which results in a Bayesian estimate of 41%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solve for: Probability Blue given witness testimony&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-math&#34; data-lang=&#34;math&#34;&gt;- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the cab being Blue)
- P(G) = 0.85 (prior probability of the cab being Green)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness identifying the cab as Blue if it was Blue)
- P(W|G) = 0.20 (probability of the witness identifying the cab as Blue if it was Green)
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|G) * P(G)]
P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138
≈ 41.38%

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment systems are liquidity intensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks have to deposit collateral and then get credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can also recycle payments received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower liquidity higher delays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Efficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A → B ($3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A → B ($1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B → A ($1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B → A ($2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-in-first-out liquidity efficiency = 1.75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offsetting (seek netting sets) LE = 2.33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc reordering (bypass large payments) LE = 2.33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full reordering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the optimal order in which transactions should be processed to maximize the liquidity efficiency of the system? Processing time grows exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe use an algorithm similar to median of medians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NP-Hard optimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical properties of quantum computer delivers a better heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the quantum optimizer before it goes to the high-value payments system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer that is being used (owned by DWAVE): DWave 5,000 Qubits, 700 maximum payment requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIgher payments delay cost for the liquidity savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#questions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are we settling payments one by one if they are are aggregated at the end of the day. Is the roadblock not regulatory
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payments must be settled at end of day, and there are throughput guidelines for during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it actually work then?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The payments need to be settled real time, which is why this problem came to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The payment queue builds up when the banks have exhausted their credit limit. The central bank then tries to use an algorithm to clear off as many as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the Quantum solution actually being used right now?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no, it&amp;rsquo;s just a study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation @ 2.8%  wanted to bring it down to 2% but not really possible anymore. Jobs report are strong so can&amp;rsquo;t really do any cuts yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job report and interest rate cuts are very highly connected. 2-yr treasury rate fell to 4.79 when it was over 5 a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed funds rates (US interbank borrowing rate), 2yr treasury&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual mandate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things causing inflation: monetary (demand), non-monetary (supply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the policy discussion reflect the yield curve is market driven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield curve: yield vs maturity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose 2-year yield has dropped in anticipation of interest rate cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is refunding regarding bond auctions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government borrowing through issuance of bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refund: refinancing of existing debt
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issuing debt to buy back older debt that was probably issued at higher rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probably higher if investors think that the yield will decrease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada mandate is to promote economic and financial welfare, unlike the Federal Reservers mandate which is both price level and unemployment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECB: European Central Bank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is high inflation, coupons are worth less and the higher interest keeps bond prices lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to invest in? Treasury 2-4yr, Corporate, Provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Agency Securities: debt taken by government corporations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Quotes from dealers are dollar plus 1/32nds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To calculate the bid-ask spread, take all asks and all bids and calculate the difference between the lowest ask and the highest bid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if there is an ask of 95 plus 22 and a bid of 95 plus 17, the bid-ask spread is 5/32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can infer that there is an implicit ask yield that is lower than the bid yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the bid-ask spread is a proxy for (lack of) liquidity&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Callability is the ability for the issuer to call the bond back
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually when interest rates drop, or the firms rating improves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although the callability itself leads to a premium, call protections is typical for the first half of the bond&amp;rsquo;s life which reduces the flexibility of the firm&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When countries export to US, they get USD currency. To get pay workers, these corporations need to acquire RMB, so they increase the currency exchange rate, which would make exports less attractive. Therefore, the foreign central banks want to facilitate the exchange rate themselves. With all the extra USD, they want to earn a rate of return. So therefore, they invest in the safest security; treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are they abandoning treasuries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When US overnight lending rates go higher, the bond prices go down too. QE: federal reserve buys the bonds. Foreign demand (China and Japan) has been lower coincidentally further once rates started going up. Japanese and Chinese cost to buy debt has gone up due to a higher currency exchange rate. US domestic buyers (mutual funds, households, pension funds, insurance companies) are filling in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repurchase Agreements. Bank A has cash, Bank B has treasuries. A Repo means that Bank B will repurchase from Bank A at a higher price at a later date. The difference between the prices is an implied paid interest also known as the repo rate. The difference between the collateral value and the cash received is called the haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers are usually: hedge funds, investment banks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If nobody wants to lend to you in a repo market, you basically collapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takeaway is to always have a backup plan in case the rumours come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repo: borrowing dollars against a collateral
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bullish: want to buy low and sell high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse-repo: lending dollars against a collateral
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearish: want to sell high buy low&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Usually means market participants don&amp;rsquo;t want to lend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, liquidity was low while securities were high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate Tax Payments drain liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPM, BOA, CITI, Wells Fargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repo markets depending more on big 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These four were blamed for the liquidity, but they cannot be relied upon like the central bank can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamie Dimon shifted the blame and said it was due to liquidity coverage rate
(LCR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before, Federal reserves provided liquidity due to great recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal funds rate is the interbank overnight lending rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Collateral Repo Rate is different
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published by the US Federal Reserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a crisis, government collateral takes precedence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually the two rates are overlapping, but sometimes they depart the repo rate falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repo rate is below the federal funds rate because there is collateral&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 24, 2015, Greg Becker testified to U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker’s goal was to provide evidence in support of raising the threshold of US$50 billion in assets for the enforcement of enhanced prudential standards on SVB Financial under the Dodd-Frank Act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those standard had become become effective as of June 1, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;many banks complained that these regulations imposed onerous costs on the&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB Financial had reported total assets of $39.3 billion in its 10-K filing for the end of fiscal year 2014, and average total assets of $33.0 billion for fiscal year 2014.5 These figures placed SVB above the threshold of $10 billion for some enhanced prudential standards, and close to the $50 billion cut-off for the full array of enhanced prudential standards [additional capital and risk management requirements]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DF: company-level stress tests and mandatory risk committees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becker testimony (starting quote):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB, like our mid-sized bank peers, does not present systemic risks. &amp;hellip; Dodd-Frank Act requirements that were designed for the largest bank holding companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question to answer is if traditional banking - taking deposits and lending to growing companies that drive job creation and investors in those companies, has systemic risk. Was Dodd-Frank Act really designed for the biggest banks (BHC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thresholds for enforcement were materially increased several years later, partially due to Becker’s testimony&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2021, the parent company reported $211.5 billion in period-end total assets and $166.0 billion in average assets for the fiscal year - 438 per cent growth in total assets - yet it was below the asset threshold for strict scrutiny. Based on Exhibit 5, the balance sheet blew up in 2020 and then again in 2021. From $70B at the end of 2019 to 208 at the start of 2022. Let&amp;rsquo;s create loan-asset ratios, and deposit loan ratios. Compare to a Canadian bank to get a picture of the size of SVB before and after its balance sheet expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone care to guess what factor the threshold increase by? The threshold had become $250B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should becker continue to invest in fixed income securities with the rapid growth of deposits? At the end of 2021, treasury bond rates were 0.39 per cent for one-year, 1.26 per cent for five-year, and 1.52 per cent for 10-year bonds. Should SVB chase higher yields provided by longer-term bonds and accept higher interest rate risk? What risk management practices should SVB follow? Deposit base is largely uninsured, what is the risk exposure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;svb-background&#34; &gt;SVB Background
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#svb-background&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1983, SVB specialized in serving the tech industry. The business model is very simple. Provide loans to companies on the condition that the VC money of these startups is parked at their bank. The businesses were high growth, high risk with high adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did it go public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we mention dot com?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under TARP, SVB received $235M for series B preferred stock. In 2009, SVB issued a $300M equity offering to redeem the preferred shares. In 2015, it stated that it server 65% of US startups. Syndicated loans (explain this) and foreign currency management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SVB was the only US financial institution working with virtual currency start-ups&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance sheet: $66 billion in loans, $125 billion in securities, and $13 billion in cash as of the end of 2021. $175B in deposits with 97% being over the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threshold. Tolerance of idiosyncrasy is why it was favoured among startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample loan agreement with a client (turn into bullet points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain all of its and all of its Subsidiaries’ operating accounts, depository accounts, and excess cash with Bank and Bank’s Affiliates; provided, however, Foreign Subsidiaries of Borrower may maintain accounts outside of the United States with financial institutions other than Bank and Bank’s Affiliates. In addition to the foregoing, Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower, and any Guarantor shall obtain any business credit card exclusively from Bank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank receiving short-term deposits and extending longer-term. Mortgages could have up to 30-year terms but commercial and industrial loans were typically offered with five-year term. &lt;em&gt;maturity transformation&lt;/em&gt; (read definition in notes before). Bank profits: difference in spread of interest paid on deposits and interest earned from borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Interest Margin = Interest Revenue-Interest Expenses / Average Earning Assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks: maturity transformation, credit risk, interest rate risk, and bank run risk. 2008 washington mutual failed due to mortgage defaults. Deteriorating housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A charge-off is writing off a loan as a loss and recoveries is what was gained on debt that was delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds that can be withdrawn on demand are &lt;em&gt;runnable&lt;/em&gt;. If the clients lose faith in the solvency of their bank, they will rush to withdraw funds, similar to the Great Depression of 1929, after which the Banking Act of 1933 established the FDIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2021, &lt;strong&gt;unlike&lt;/strong&gt; many other banks, SVB invested significant amount in held-to-maturity securities. $98.2B on the balance sheet, compared to $65.9B in loans. On the April 22, 2021 earnings call, CFO Daniel J. Beck responded to questions about the HTM portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen just incredible liquidity growth continuing. Comfortable holding 3-5 year range maturities. Available for sale category is 2-year duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought process was that stability of liquidity will persist. Agency securities, Agency mortgage Backs, agency CMOs in 3-5 year range. Compared to 2015, the bank is doing more than just deposits and loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts standards deem that HTM will be shown at the amortized cost, rather than fair value whereas available for sale securities will be recorded at fair value. The classification is based on the buyer&amp;rsquo;s intent. Securities should not be classified as HTM if a change in interest rates and liquidity needs would prompt a sale. Sales only allowed when debt issuer creditworthiness changes, regulatory changes, or major changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Act required board to to have a risk committee including an expert in &amp;ldquo;identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposure of large, complex financial  firms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Dunbar was chair since 2012, director since 2004, and was the chair of the risk-committee from the inception and still serving at the end of 2021. The board met seven times in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB also had a chief risk officer Laura Izurieta since 2016 with an extensive career at Capital One, Freddie Mac, and Bank of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB had lobbied hard for Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Regulation YY increased company-run stress tests from $10B to $250B and risk committees from $10B to $50B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2019,  US Federal Reserve issued a Matters Requiring Attention regarding the risk management practices (reference 67)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest Rate Risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although treasuries are safe from the perspective that its backed by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modified Duration: percentage decline in fixed income security&amp;rsquo;s value for one percentage point increase in the discount rate. % change in price = -MD * delta y. reference 72. The durations are given. Maybe use inflation data or money supply data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If B(y) is the price of the bond, then B(y +- delta y) is the bond price at a higher/lower discount rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD = - (B(y + delta y) - B(y - delta y)) / 2 dela y * 1/B(y)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolio modified durations are the weighted average of each individual security.s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration of uninsured deposits is 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dollar Value of 01&lt;/code&gt;: dollar change of assets for a change in 1 basis point in discount rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DV01 = -MD * 0.0001 * original value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After calculating DV01, FOMC (Federal Open  Market Commitee) generally increased federal funds rate in increments of 25 bps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB was aware of the risks as seen in their 2021 10K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage interest rate risk on the AFS portfolio, they have interest rate swap contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of the securities. hedge accounting (see Intermediate Accounting II).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interest rate swap is a derivative where two parties agree to exchange payments for a set amount of time. In this case, at the end of the year for multiple years. One party, SVB in this case makes a fixed payment and the counterparty will pay  based on the future interest rate of SOFR (secured overnight financing rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No information was provided regarding the maturities of these swap contracts, although the maturities are for two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was risk management using swaps appropriately? Increase or decrease the use of swaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently using $10.7B in notional interest rate swaps. Do some stress tests basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to reuse the interest rate swap from the case when explaining the concept on the slide deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;svb-failure&#34; &gt;SVB Failure
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#svb-failure&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday March 9th, 2023, depositors withdrew almost 25% of deposits. On March 10, it was presumed that everything would be withdrawn. Regulators were forced to close the bank in the middle of the day. The second-biggest failure in nominal terms in US history, second to Washington Mutual Bank. Silicon Valley Bank was highly unusual in that about 94 percent of its deposits are large enough to be uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC limit of $250,000 per account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA changed in 2019 which relaxed rules for banks like SVB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB had systemtic risk. Panic of 2023: Signature Bank became third largest failure on Sunday March 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “systemic-risk exception” included in a 1991 law allows the FDIC to act immediately without taking time to seek out a least-cost method of resolving a bank failure: in this case, the FDIC announced that even uninsured depositors would be fully covered at both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the Federal Reserve stepped in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, the Federal Reserve invoked its power to take action during “unusual and exigent circumstances” that was included in a 1935 revision of the Federal Reserve Act and created a novel emergency-lending program with generous terms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes sense since one of the problems during the great depression was the lack of a central bank and thus the money supply
dropped tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Republic Bank failed in May, which became at the new second-largest bank failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the panic spread to Europe and Credit Suisse, which in April 2023 became the single largest bank failure in the world, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;significant “unrealized” losses on assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;net interest margin: difference between interest earned and paid for via its assets and liabilities. Assets pay interest, and liabilities incur interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019: $70 billion of assets ($33B loans - credit lines to SVB customers rather than project loans or residential/commercial mortgages, $28B securities - exclusively government or agency-backed bonds) and $63B deposits. The securities holding of 40% was above national average of 25%, but not an outlier. Reasoning to hold loans: higher yield to store funds that will be lent out. 2. source of liquidity. Cash was $6B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC: most accounts covered, and only 42% of total deposits are over this limit. The specific choice of $250,000 as the legal threshold is an attempt to balance the benefits (financial stability) and costs (excess risk-taking by banks) of insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Insurance backed by standing fund financed by insurance premiums charged to banks, with a credit line from the US Treasury and the full faith and credit of the United States standing as additional lines of defense. Although uninsured deposits don&amp;rsquo;t have explicit protection, in most bank failures FDIC has transferred the deposit base to another bank which allows the depositors to be made whole. The total losses in the last 30 years has been less than $300M. Implicit safety. Concentration in the largest banks. Out of bank with more than $50B in assets, SVB stood out for having the highest percentage of uninsured deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since customer deposits can be withdrawn on demand, they have a maturity of zero, whereas the assets need to earn their net interest margin and thus have higher maturities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between the Assets and Liabilities is considered Equities, but from a bank&amp;rsquo;s perspective, this is Cushion Capital which is used to protect depositors and debtholders from variations int eh value of the assets. It was a mere $5B in 2019. This cushion is how bank checks and deposits have a no-questions-asked property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A depositor is not going to do a deep analysis on whether their bank is safe given a multi-component deposits. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to withdraw their deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB was $3B already insolvent (negative $3B in equity) by December 2022 when assets were marked to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVB relied on stickiness to hedge interest-rate risk. stickiness allowed the dotted line to be so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dreschler, Savov, and Schnabl (2021), deposit spread is a remarkable hedge against interest-rate risk. From a valuation perspective, the net present value of the deposit spread can be called the &amp;ldquo;franchise value of deposits&amp;rdquo; which isn&amp;rsquo;t included in the balance sheets. This value in theory goes up when interest rates rise. Therefore, although from a balance sheet perspective, many banks were close to insolvency, the stickiness of deposits makes banks. Therefore lack of stickiness results in insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear of Collapse Begets Collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From public filings, everyone could tell with some math that the bank was insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial shock arrived on March 8, 2023 [10-K] report, when Silicon Valley Bank announced that it had sold $24 billion of book value securities earlier that day for a loss of $1.8 billion, along with a plan to raise $2.25 billion of new equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000719739/eede72d3-1cc6-45ee-89cf-3dc4f59469ad.pdf&#34;&gt;March 8th 2023 8K notable event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000719739/f36fc4d7-9459-41d7-9e3d-2c468971b386.pdf&#34;&gt;February 24th 2023 10K annual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 27, 2023, Becker sold 12,451 shares of company stock, worth a total of $3.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in, 12 days they sold their entire AFS portfolio meaning that management were only thinking of the decision after February 24th. Therefore, deposit withdrawals must&amp;rsquo;ve been occurring within days of the 10K being filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it takes to lose the no-questions-asked property is the salience of questions of why the bank had to sell assets for a loss. The next day, many depositors withdrew because
to depositors its cheaper to transfer to another bank than to transfer after the bank has already collapsed even if their funds are implicitly secured. Depositors don&amp;rsquo;t read 8Ks, they just see big loss and withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we will realize a one-time, post-tax earnings loss of approximately $1.8 billion in connection with the sale, we expect the reinvestment of the proceeds to be immediately accretive to net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM), resulting in a short payback period of approximately three years. As a result of these actions, we expect an approximately $450 million post-tax improvement in annualized NII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before today, we had ample liquidity and flexibility to manage our liquidity position, with one of the lowest loan-to-deposit ratios of any bank of our size, income from progressive securities paydowns, levers to manage our off-balance sheet client funds, and substantial borrowing capacity. The improved cash liquidity, profitability and financial flexibility resulting from the actions we announced today will bolster our financial position and our ability to support clients through sustained market pressures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NII: net interest income (magnitude)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIM: net income margin (spread)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took the bank into receivership in the morning—the first intraday receivership in its history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violation of no-questions-asked property at many other banks with a high percentage of uninsured deposits combined with significant unrealized losses on their assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks hit on Friday, March 10: Signature Bank ($110 billion in asset, $10B outflows), First Republic Bank, with ($213 billion, $25B outflows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signature Bank had no pre-positioned collateral at the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC has a least cost duty unless they invoke systemic risk exception enacted in 1991. Positive vote from the boards of both the FDIC and Federal Reserve.
SVB was not marked as systemic previously. No losses will be borne by the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;idiosyncratic: having strange or unusual habits, ways of behaving, or features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Term Funding Program introduced: instead of borrowing market value minus small cushion, allows borrowing up to par value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Regulations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 7 percent, the ratio at Silicon Valley Bank at the end of 2019 was below the 9.66 percent average for insured banks in the United States, but still above the acceptable minimum of 4 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Regulations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reserve requirements; minimum cash-to-deposits ratio; can&amp;rsquo;t survive full run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we need to evaluate how we supervise and regulate a bank’s management of interest rate risk. While interest rate risk is a core risk of banking that is not new to banks or supervisors, SVB did not appropriately manage its interest rate risk, and supervisors did not force the bank to fix these issues quickly enough”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US doesn&amp;rsquo;t have rules to do mark-to-market interest rate stress tests, but the EU does, but the lower interest-rate risk there is shifted to credit-risk due to issuance of higher variable interest rate loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information event that calls into question a bank’s solvency can quickly become self-reinforcing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-493-behavioural-finance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Textbook #1: Behavioural Finance, Psychology, Decision-Making, and Markets, Ackert &amp;amp; Deaves, South-Western Cengage Learning 2018 (available through the library’s DTA program)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/literary-analysis/thinking-fast-and-slow-daniel-kahneman&#34;&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested additional reading: The Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testable cases: Enron (2), Seagram, Risk Profiling, Shattered Sears&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshmallow study: children taking one marshmallow now or waiting five minutes to get two. Study flawed because it only focused on stanford kids (affluence) and wasn&amp;rsquo;t transferable when looking at kids who are less affluent. Ability to postpone gratification at an early age led to more successful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Flynn effect: IQ scores been rising without known effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-expected-utility-theory&#34; &gt;Chapter 1 Expected Utility Theory
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#chapter-1-expected-utility-theory&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seek to maximize our consumption utility. Imperfect measurements. Tradeoff is cost ($ and time). Rational. Self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospect theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people make decisions based on how they &lt;strong&gt;perceive&lt;/strong&gt; trade-offs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceive: humane element; emotional, rational, instincts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: what is the mind behind a collector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss aversion&lt;/strong&gt;: fear losses more than gains
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gains have to significantly outweigh the losses to incentivize humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments have to be marketed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive limitations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People making weird decisions because they are ignorant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bounded Rationality
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bounded to your knowledge and experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;often in the case of investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not daily job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mortgage timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we personally evaluate risk, rewards, preferences, and utility. Bias: emotional and cognitive bias. Requires high self-regulation, self-reflection, and humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;want to moderate these&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bounded Rationality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Heuristics (everyone says so, commonly accepted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamay got people to consume and move away from the buy once use forever mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Dissonance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything contrary to your belief is disregarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halo effect on someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision Making Process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer behaviour and investment behaviour is similar for people without training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need better frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros vs Cons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impulse, lack of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional finance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rational assumption: people still not doing things good for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient at obtaining the right information: is the information really readily accessible and do they know it&amp;rsquo;s relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unbiased&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires discreteness, indifference curves, transitivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indifference curve optimally is the biggest slope tangent to the curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayes Theorem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(expected given I)  = P(E) * P(I given E) / P(I)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bayes updates probability given new information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rational Economic Man
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges: humans affected by many emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioural finance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are normal (may exhibit flaws)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People relying on others
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tulips crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;genetic mutations that were rare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on observed investor and market behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenges efficient market hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macro (herd, society, bubble)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional of policy, incentives (e.g. Soviet Union using tonnage of the shipped for compensation instead of quality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional: risk averse and curve is upward sloping and diminishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioural: risk evaluation is reference dependent. Risk seeking for some level of wealth (e.g. lottery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double inflection: utility function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move from risk averse to risk seeking at different income levels&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;classification models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confident, impetuous, careful, anxious, methodical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adventurer: Investors who are confident as well as make impulsive decisions have been classified as the adventurer in the BBK model. These are the kinds of investors who will make very risky investments. They are often seen investing in the futures and options space with high amounts of leverage. Often, they put all of their money on one single bet based on the level of confidence they might have on that bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the advisor’s point of view, such investors can be difficult to give advice to. This is because they have their own ideas about investing and are not afraid to test them in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Celebrities: These investors are also known for making impulsive decisions. However, instead of being confident, they are known for being anxious. This is the worst combination of traits amongst the four quadrants! The celebrities are not confident. Hence, they do not have their own investment theories. This means that they are gullible and are often taken advantage of by middlemen who want them to trade excessively so that they can earn commissions in the process. As an ethical advisor, one may have to make emotional appeals to this type of investor since they often do not respond to rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Individualists: This category of investors is both confident as well as methodical. These types of investors have their own investment philosophy. They tend to know something about the market or at least make an attempt to learn before they invest their hard-earned money. Also, since they are very rational and analytical, they tend to come to the right conclusion. This is the best combination of traits in the four quadrants. Such investors are closest to the textbook rational investors. However, it needs to be noted that very few investors actually fall in this category. These are the best possible clients for an investment advisor since it is possible to make rational arguments and convince these investors. If it makes sense, then convincing these investors will be easy. If they are made aware of their behavioral biases, they are most likely to correct their course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian: The guardians are anxious as well as careful at the same time. This category of investors generally comprises of old people who are nearing retirement. These people tend to be quite methodical when it comes to decision making. However, they are also quite anxious about the safety of the money that they invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardians are generally people who have a limited earning capability. Hence, they are more likely to preserve the assets that they have instead of taking risks. Guardians are generally not interested in volatile investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an investment advisor, they can be difficult to advise since they are also partly driven by the emotion of fear. If these clients get a feeling that the advisor is overbearing, they are most likely to change the advisors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Straight Arrow: The four main quadrants are already described above. However, the BBK model has been extended to include a fifth category. This category is represented in the center, i.e., the interaction of the two axes. They are called the straight arrows. This is where a lot of investors tend to fall. These investors are known to have a composite of all the four traits and hence are known to be fairly balanced. Oftentimes, they are called the average investor since most investors a person comes across are likely to fall in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, overconfident CEOs who overestimate future firm performance are more likely to provide positive information to analysts, thus increasing the likelihood of analysts issuing optimistic earnings forecasts for firms with over- confident CEOs. Second, overconfident CEOs may overestimate the precision of their information and disclose more precise information, which in turn may result in less dispersed analyst forecasts. Finally, managers who exhibit over- confidence show an increased willingness to voluntarily disclose information through management earnings guidance, which may lead to smaller forecast errors relative to managers who are less willing to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding onto options that are in the money is considered over-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% more optimistic analyst forecasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.4% to 4.3% smaller forecast errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% to 3.8% smaller forecast deviations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;market experience, which is symptomatic of past success, is associated with higher levels of overconfidence&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Player 1 gives money to Player 2, amount is multiplied&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;older people are less ambiguity averse but indifferent when it comes to risky decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Casino at Niagara Falls&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when a retail investor creates an order? It goes to the retail brokerage, and then gets sold to a wholesaler (marketmaker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t sell directly to wholesaler or brokerage because there&amp;rsquo;s capital requirements for the exchanges/wholesalers. Registered &lt;strong&gt;broker-dealer status&lt;/strong&gt; to connect to an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sane, sophisticated, experienced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brokerages exist to prevent incorrect trades to break the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each exchange has their own engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as fast as possible to execute trades (e.g. HFT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colocation to the exchange (physically located)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying space right beside the exchange servers (no metre of advantage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;servers are located in the same servers as the exchanges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most located in New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSX servers located in Markham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electricity crisis/costs in big cities are higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In US, there are 3-4 data centres (NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSEARCA, CBOE which controls DirectEdge, BAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does CBOE own DirectEdge and BAT
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economies of scale (technology sharing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed costs: very high technology costs, software engineering labour, strategy costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tends to favour larger companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges do no trade, invest, participate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All intermediaries benefit from ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediation costs $1T per year to run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FINRA ADF
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trades that occur off the exchange (retail and wholesalers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholesalers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citadel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtu (between C &amp;amp; V, 71% of all retail flow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;G1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Sigma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane Street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merrill Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morgan Stanley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Canada, there are no wholesalers, retail brokers send orders directly to the exchange
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US system is unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bid-Ask Spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask (higher price)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bid (lower price)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a bid-ask spread of 0.01, how can a bid at the lower price be filled?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive and Passive Orders (vice-versa for buying and selling)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive buy at higher price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US retailers are mostly market buy orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerages might try to dark pattern market orders instead of limit orders
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? Payment for order flow incentivizes market orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does SEC allow it? wholesalers have handshake agreements to price-improve the current spread. Brokers regularly evaluate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slippage: different in market price and market fill price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passive, buy at lower price, takes longer, might not execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spreads have been widening since 2010 but we have higher liquidity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is due to higher prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are spreads wider for higher priced stocks (not market cap)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional investors set the spreads: market making firms who also do wholesaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue sources:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaving off teeny tiny haircuts from every share that is traded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#market-makers&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do more than just wholesaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine what spreads are going to be and how wide
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other entities do exist but will learn later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main line of business is liquidity provisioning (impatient to patient investors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market makers put up capital to make the market
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital gets locked up while waiting for buyers to come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since capital that gets locked up is greater per share, and there is a required rate of return, the spread is higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding inventories of stock that they have bought from impatient sellers or had sold to patient buyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does fractional trading play into this?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berkshire Hathaway notorious for not splitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retail investors: &amp;ldquo;idiocratic volatility&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commitment with retail brokerage to share cashflow of the share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two big costs (applicable to wholesalers as well)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adverse Selection costs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A phenomena/cost when taking the other side of the trade with an informed entity at a large scale (institutional investor, hedge fund, insider trader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can just be pressure on price even in the short-term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory costs: movement against you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs are high for institutional and low for retail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there is mixed flow, the exchange costs are lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there is only institutional flow, there is only high costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hedge-funds&#34; &gt;Hedge Funds

    &lt;a href=&#34;#hedge-funds&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a hedge fund buys a stock, the price goes up, the liquidity is eaten up. Suppose the market maker has a short inventory position. That&amp;rsquo;s a terrible place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retail investors are the products for payment for order flow (PFOF) brokerages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment is called&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFOF goes from wholesaler to the brokerage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail sentiment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally less informed than institutional investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why retail specifically? lower adverse selection costs since retail investors aren&amp;rsquo;t as informed and inventory since order flow is balanced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholesaler expects order flow to be balanced from retail customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: Spread of 10.00 and 10.06. The price improvement is 10.05 or 10.01 meaning the revenue is 4 cents. On the exchange, they would make a higher spread, however there is higher adverse selection and inventory costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between the market price and the true price (midpoint), is the price for liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is losing?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of all volume is diverted away from exchanges, so the exchanges lose out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who put limit orders into exchange are providing liquidity also lose out since they don&amp;rsquo;t get it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional investors are pissed because the market markers have costs to set the spread so that the costs are covered plus profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail brokerages will send all flow, not just a subsect of the flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So something like Citadel has to accept flow from GME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PFOF is 1% of spread whereas price improvement is 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argue that without PFOF, there is lower liquidity costs for everyone since market maker costs are lower&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most brokers only have a channel to a wholesaler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, the broker evaluates (price improvement) the wholesaler to continue sending the flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentive to go with the highest PFOF payer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher the PFOF, the worse the price improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a rule that all wholesalers that a brokerage is dealing with, are charged the same amount which eliminates the conflict of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerages like Fidelity and Vanguard don&amp;rsquo;t accept PFOF but still send it to wholesalers because there&amp;rsquo;s price improvement for clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t brokerages like TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab do their own wholesaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They realized they don&amp;rsquo;t have the expertise as Virtu and Citadel do (no proprietary tech)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 commission
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No PFOF, no 0 commissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RobinHood and few other startup brokerages lowered commissions until it got to $0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RobinHood finances $0 commissions via PFOF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerages can finance it through other business divisions and margin interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t have to run the flow against their balance, they can forward it to the exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very high fixed costs, so Citadel and Virtu have the lowest per order cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a transfer of the savings of the economies of scale to retailers due to brokerages evaluating the performance of each wholesaler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerages are very big players (TD Ameritrade is the biggest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citadel is vertically integrated and technologically advanced with billions invested to be the highest efficiency, and it has diversification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proponents of PFOF: 27-28% price improvement over the spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People against PFOF: Benchmark of using the spread is flawed in the first place
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges are deprived of ability to interact with retail flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the spread is a flawed benchmark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argument is wrong because there are other market participants that can place bids and ask to narrow the spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the market orders went directly to the exchange, the spread would narrow but not as much because there is flow from both institutions and retailers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of removing PFOF, want to increase the competition of wholesalers. SEC wants to run auctions for each retail order so that all institutions will bring all buys and sells to the mid-quote (SEC Order Competition Rule).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small caps and micro-caps will fail at auctions because its all retail flow. If did not exist, they would not want to deal with micro-caps either, leading to higher costs for retail. Institutions will not be able to fill that gap. It undermines US JOBS act of 2012 passed by congress. From Congress&amp;rsquo;s and economic perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s fair for large stocks to subsidize small stocks. Congress represents people, so it represents the people&amp;rsquo;s will as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail flow is balance and so everyone gets their flow done. Institutions will only trade when the stock is trading in their interests, so it&amp;rsquo;s always only one side that gets properly dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paper profit realization probability? Very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the knowledge that someone holds shares in a company a downside? They don&amp;rsquo;t need to disclose it until 5% of a company is owned. In Canada the threshold should be higher due to the difference in company sizes and yes it is 10%. Disclosure has downside because then everyone else will want to take advantage of the company if they are asking for counter party offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Kevin starts trading too aggressively through marketable limit orders (a limit order that can immediately be executed against the order book) people will figure out the signal. What are Kevin&amp;rsquo;s choices? Best choice is to go slow and through dark markets. Dark only applied to pre trade transparency. Once trade has occured by law, it has to be reported to the public record of transactions. Dark pools used to be millisecond delays but that&amp;rsquo;s been considerably reduced too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that dark pool does for you. The problem with &amp;ldquo;lit&amp;rdquo; exchanges is that everything is shown: the order book. As soon as you make a trade the market knows where the price is going.
What are these crossing networks? How to sell using cross networks (Jessica at Deutsche Bank) without market falling. Jessica said she had a client who was willing to buy 100k. The transaction hit the tape. What happens next? Ticked up by two cents 19.02-19.03. The market inferred there was either someone wants to buy more to sell more than 100,000 shares. If the buyer crosses the spread then that&amp;rsquo;s the signal that the buyer is potentially more informed than the seller. Therefore an intelligent seller can get together a bunch of buyers and sell to each of them in a way where they have to cross the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he wants to sell 250,000 at 19.02 which would signal to market that the seller wants to sell more. If Jessica cared about the buyer she would not want the price to move up. The solution would probably be to sell at the mid-quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to post quotes that could have been fulfilled (lock or cross). When is this a problem? When two exchanges have different best offers. It&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to happen but exchanges work hard to reconcile that by routing market orders to each other? The exchange that is offending would slide down the offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing fragmentation tries to say that the same order could get different deals but there&amp;rsquo;s arbitraging as well as a regulation: exchanges are mandated to route orders to the exchange with the best deal. &lt;strong&gt;Trade through rule&lt;/strong&gt;. If the exchange knows that there is a better quote somewhere, then the trader has to get the best possible price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there&amp;rsquo;s a NASDAQ quote with 100 shares at 10.00, NYSE with 10,000 shares at 10.01, and a BATS quote with 100,000 shares at 10.02. If a firm wants the BATS quantity, they just buy from NASDAQ and then go directly to BATS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO orders: dear BATS, do not re-route order to the best quote since the order sender guarantees its been taken. In Canada, the ISO order informs the exchange that all the best quotes on other exchanges have been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;electronic front running&lt;/em&gt;: back-running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;slow-market arbitrage&lt;/em&gt;: latency arbitrage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors Exchange (IEX) Exchange. It was founded in 2013 as a dark pool, and turned into an exchange in 2016. IEX has 38 miles of coiled fiber optic cable between its matching engine and servers used by HFTs giving IEX a 0.35 millisecond head start versus HFTs. This gives HFTs a disadvantage at re-pricing their quotes. How does it actually solve the problem? Is it because the quotes are delayed? Limit orders will be re-priced by the exchange before the orders that are in the coil get to the exchange. IEX is pegged to the other exchanges&amp;rsquo; quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity begets liquidity. IEX trying to do the HFTs / market makers job by doing it for them. The problem is that HFTs are just better at it. So HFTs end up staying away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is spoiling the market? Brad kept calling people (shopping around) to see if anyone wants it but since he calls the wrong people, it tips people off. Broker connects two parties, a dealer could also hold inventory themselves? If the dealer does not tolerate inventory risk, they can impatiently trade out of large positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his last 3,000,000 million shares, the offer was 19.10. Since the initial share price was 19.04, 19.10 is much better than the initial price at the decision price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan Weller, does algorithmic trading reduce information acquisition? Markets are complicated. Without funds like FLV, price discovery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t occur since they do fundamental research. As they do their job, they are also adversely selecting market makers who are providing liquidity. Modern market is bad at price discovery since hedge funds choose not to do research into everything anymore, since they know its harder to act on the research do to the sensitivity of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NYSE specialist: central human market maker made obsolete due to electronic trading but they have been replaced by something else today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASDAQ introduction? because it was too monopolistic. NYSE had one specialist per basket of stocks.

&lt;p&gt;NYSE started in 1792, physically trading. Buttonwood tree. System of human specialists, which are central market markers to make the market for a basket of stocks. The worry is a being ripped off (overcharging for liquidity) by the market maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s the NASDAQ was created due to specialist over-charing concern as well as fragmentation. Needed an exchange to list faster (tech), where companies that are innovating and couldn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for the NYSE. NASDAQ chose to have multiple dealers providing liquidity on NASDAQ or so the argument goes. Then NASDAQ asked companies to move to them. Back then, there was n cross trading. What were the actual results? NASDAQ has more expensive liquidity which normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense due to micro-economic theory. Explanation: dealers were colluding to overcharge. This hold true even after accounting for different stocks trading. When the same stock would move from NASDAQ to NYSE, its liquidity would improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dealers were caught because they stopped as soon as the first article went out and because people noticed, there was a big investigation. Billion dollar settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two major changes to the markets in the late 1990s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase competition from other markets (stocks trade on all exchanges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone can submit limit orders to the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 1 cent per quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialists had to go because it was hard to go from 12.5 cents 6.25 cents to 1 cent. 7-10 years without dealers and specialists market making. Early 2000s had only voluntary (endogenous) liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When technology allowed for it, trading started happening continuously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older was waiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batching  is better because continuous trading increased latency arbitrage and adverse selection and the benefits are cancelled out by the cons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In batched, all orders came, intermediate them, and then execute them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous would happen too quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adverse selection is higher in continuous because there are more signals, more price fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch is better because less limit order signals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is less opportunity for arbitrage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a batch market, market makers are given time to adjust their stale quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With continuous, you have to be fastest to reprice your quotes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one market maker can be the fastest, since that is how physics and the engine works (engine does not wait, it immediately executes orders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other market makers have to compensate by increasing the spreads
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then the fastest market maker also widens their spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taker traders pay the cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore continuous markets might be costing society more than comfortable batch markets, where executions occur within a second&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quotes are accumulated by all the fastest market makers, not just the fastest one
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which means the spread can lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel came out with their own analysis that says continuous trading is better. But their analysis is flawed due to using market volatility as the spread and then they conveniently skipped that there are quotes beyond the best bid and offers (deeper in the book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citadel makes money as a fast market maker and HFT so they do not want to have to adapt to new changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study from Sweden has data on what Citadel does and they found that Citadel makes money sniping other people&amp;rsquo;s stale quotes than it loses on its own quotes being sniped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan was batched in 2020 and then moved to continuous trading and the execution costs were measured (5% increase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to batched markets not happening anytime soon. Industry lobby is too big and SEC/government is way too busy in adding their own regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s stopping IEX? They would lose volume due to market participants boycotting.
People who pay for this new system would be people who don&amp;rsquo;t benefit from the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerages cannot send orders to an arbitrary exchange, but rather send orders best on best quotes. Exchanges are not allowed to own brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYSE (blue-chip) and NASDAQ (tech) don&amp;rsquo;t really dominate, since they are 24% combined market share (modern trading landscape pie graph).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside to multiple exchanges: With multiple exchanges, there&amp;rsquo;s also greater adverse selection across exchanges, which can push spreads wider (arbitraging). Redundant capital investments but consensus is that multiple markets is better. Hurts institutional investors who have to split orders to the liquidity on all exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Prioritization of shareholders not just market makers and regulators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shareholders want profit, so now exchanges have to make the most money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange makes most money from trading fees, data, and listing fees (IPOs).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data revenue going to be fixed, listings are cyclical, but trading is also cyclical, but forever
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading volumes matters the most, so how to make traders trade more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges care about market makers the most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citadel: 20% of NYSE volume, Virtu is another 20%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem: during the previous year (2008), there was an influx of volume, but when volume fell cracks started to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super dark pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All institutional&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t show anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size discovery facility; trades large transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average is 300 on other dark pools versus POSIT 50,000 shares (you don&amp;rsquo;t know it will be like that, 40% chance)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most are mid-quote dark pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large institutions can trade their larger positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinging&lt;/strong&gt;: HFTs (anyone with the technology that wants to know) might be pinging dark pools to check for liquidity with small orders (1 share to buy and to sell)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ping weighs down the average trading size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually one side active; no market makers because there&amp;rsquo;s no spread to make money off of; the market maker would have an information advantage that they could use to manipulate the real markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG dark pool may be dismissing any pings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the reset of the information to the market to back-run the orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of trading volume and no order books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More participants maybe because of less leakage?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less leakage since each trade takes time to execute, whereby other dark pools are so low quantity signalling that someone is playing in that dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ample liquidity, does it take part in the trade itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocated Cost Efficiency: larger blocs, less trades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG Revenue
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is brokerages and bundling?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundling of brokerage services such as access to affiliated Investment Banks IPOs, capital, and analyst forecasts affiliated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggling: compared to 2008 and earlier, in 2009 the market crashed and the trading volume swelled up which means commission revenues are down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discretionary volume: dark pool revenue is down, providing for IPOs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers only sends what they can and that has gone down due to other commitments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client wants: equity research / recommendations, capital, IPO access, execution management (ITG does only this)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to be affiliated to an underwriter to access IPOs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPOs are lucrative because they tend to be underpriced; the price will pop; average 10% return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;client views ITG as a way to preserve alpha, and other competitors as alpha generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment Banks provide all of this
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also expects a certain requirement of volume for this access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPO Primary market
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment Bank sells IPOs to their clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brokerage bundling pros and cons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cons
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed the best for each of the categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to weigh the tradeoffs based on the total cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no comparative advantages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European commission undid the bundle of analyst recommendation from other stuff
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The worry was downsizing or less analysis on smaller companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happened was that the quality of analysis increased (prediction of upcoming announcements)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worse performers were dropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity research
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible that the equity research is more lenient on the company due to the conflict of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did SEC stop crusade against dark pools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does dark pool do to dark pools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG reputation went down after SEC and got acquired by Virtu after settling
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trident a big part of the infrastructure at Virtu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is ITG to do?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on higher volume clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulled out of overseas markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DId not take up proprietary trading on their own account due to erosion of trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some clients wanted ITG to sell the insights, but ITG said no&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Omega
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t look good to SEC. Settlement
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alleged that ITG would make the spread by trading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alleged that ITG would encourage institutions to cross the spread so that ITG would get the full spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG says it was for good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG would copy the trade of the dark pool on the exchange, and facilitate the sell in their own dark pool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG would try to bring liquidity from other exchanges to the dark pool market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would place a buy limit order, and if it was executed, it would sell on POSIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s bad because
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information leakage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making money off of the back-running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argument for
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expert says it&amp;rsquo;s not leaking because it&amp;rsquo;s a partial limit order
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are many limit orders, ITG&amp;rsquo;s limit orders will blend in and no tipped off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITG was doing it very carefully and even shut down the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price prediction based on the aggressor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believe informed investors activity on dark pools hurt activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;back in 2007-2008, chief economist for NASDAQ, Frank Hathaway, was testifying before congress; &amp;ldquo;if dark trading goes over 20% of all volume, hte markets will collapse.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s 40% of all volume and markets are fine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rationale: they all believed price discovery was lost in dark pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then congress got worried about it and then told SEC to worry about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark pools would&amp;rsquo;ve (not implemented) been added to National Best Bid Offer under $200k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All dark pool restrictions got cancelled once academic research came out (as a draft) and then years later in a journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zhu H 2014. Do dark pools harm price discovery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theory model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logic: informed traders are aggressive (short information), uninformed would not risk moving the price and be matched in dark pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not going to get informed traders to go to dark pools since they do not care about the spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only uninformed traders would go to dark pool (buy and sell)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions that would want to reshuffle their fund (index funds, mutual funds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informed participants would all be on one side of the dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;back then, 4% chance of trading through dark pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research: theory, empirical, experiments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theory: multi-story math equations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comerton-Ford, Putinins 2015; Dark Trading and price discovery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empirical research backing up the previous theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentration of uninformed traders meaning that noise removed and the informed traders remain on the exchanges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity is harmed by dark pool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less uninformed traders on exchanges means Informed traders are adversely selecting the market, meaning that market makers would increase spreads to compensate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore retail price improvement gets harmed as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European regulator implemented MiFID II

&lt;li&gt;Restricted dark pool trading (volume capped)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark pool trading adn information acquisition (Johnathon Brogaard and Pan 2022)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark pools do price discovery because of long-lived information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other articles are about short-lived information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since dark pool execution is slow, long-lived information (impression), that the price will increase over months, then dark pool trading might be beneficial since weeks to wait is okay. This might harm price discovery since the price is not impacted by long-lived information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are an algorithm responsible for Virtu’s activity in SPY on BATS and BATS Y, two sister exchanges. Your task is to make money by market making and/or sniping stale quotes. You observe that the price of the e-mini S&amp;amp;P 500 futures has ticked down, indicating that SPY price is also about to tick down, by 2 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPY is currently quoted at 100.00 on the bid and 100.02 on the ask. The two-cent spread in SPY is typical, and you expect it to persist. There are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;100,000 shares at the bid and 100,000 shares at the ask on BATS and
100,000 shares at the bid and 100,000 shares at the ask on BATS Y.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BATS charges 0.0030 cents/share to liquidity takers and rebates 0.0028 cents/share to liquidity makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BATS Y is an inverted market; it charges 0.0010 cents/share to liquidity makers and rebates 0.0008 cents/share to liquidity takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your technology is good, but Citadel’s is slightly better. Because of this, while Citadel’s first order will be faster than yours, its second order will be slower than your first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no more than 5 sentences, please explain what yours and Citadel’s next steps should be and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next spread is 9.98 - 10.00. Citadel will go to BATS Y and make money from the liquidity taking fees (short at 10.00, buy back at 10.00). Virtu will have to go do nothing because they would&amp;rsquo;ve had to short at 10.00 and buy back at 10.00 on BATS which would be super expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have 200,000 shares at the ask (100.01, buy at 100.00) in the front of the queue followed by 10,000 shares. The e-mini S&amp;amp;P500 futures went up indicating that SPY will tick up by 2 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to buy the entire ask of 210,000. Fees are 0.003 CENTS / share to takers and rebates are 0.0028 CENTS / share to makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10,000 (0.01 - 0.00003 - 0.00003) - 200,000 (0.00003 - 0.000028) = $99 assuming that you only reprice the 200,000 shares that were acquired instead of divesting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarifications: buying and selling to yourself is legal, but &lt;em&gt;churning&lt;/em&gt;, buying to yourself for the purposes of increasing volume and creating hype is illegal to the regulatory body. It&amp;rsquo;s legal and 3% of the data shows self-trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1980 event:  bree-ex
Tse 300:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold company called bre-ex which claimed it had a massive gold find in the Philippines. Analysts were rejecting billions of dollars of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bree-ex went from 10cents to 10th spot. When a certain size and length, auto benchmark inclusion just when scrutiny was rising. Decision was made by the index committee to bring the stock in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day bre-x was halted. Rumour: not going in. Tsx will not be added to the index. Tsx president read the headline and called ahead that the stock isn&amp;rsquo;t going in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index committee hold emergency meeting with president. Rolland says it&amp;rsquo;s a fraud and not going in the index. Index committee still put the stock in the index. 2 weeks later stock is added in the index, index funds have added, company imploded. Tsx bought in. Issuer and broker conflict of interest. Therefore s&amp;amp;p was brought in to manage the index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief geologist fell out of helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples were being salted with gold. Based on sample the vein might be bigger.
Their analyst just went over the vein instead of going on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;p did not like how tsx did it. S&amp;amp;p had public rules but the decisions are privately made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many analysts were putting buys and then telling clients it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg terminal pre-release. Automatic class action lawsuit. Company failed to report in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AML: 29 years and everyone was sad after hearing that. Accused of not having sufficient AML practices. TD was allowing mexican drug money through the US. There were people on the inside who were arrested for allowing the funds to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started market structure podcast called &lt;em&gt;Bidout&lt;/em&gt;. Had the professor as a guest speaker. Weather patterns impacting market making activities. 63 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark pools. Early 2000. Reg anx. Forced market places to be linked. In the us you always get best price. National best bid and offer. Nyse and Nasdaq lost monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsx lost its monopoly on 2007. Pure trading. Order protection rule in Canada is stronger because all best bids and offers must be satisfied whereas in the us only the top best before trading another market at another price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various broker dealers launched dark pools. Consortium pools launched. In Canada only one launched known as Matched Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference in Canada is that material price improvement against the bid or ask must occur in a Dark pool. Order exposure for retail. Launch now is owned by CBOE and was posit. Used for mid point trading. Fair access rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US dark rule: no price improvement needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broker sponsored dark pools. In the early 2010s, almost every one suffered regulatory fine for not informing clients enough. Either trading prop. In us discrimination is allowed for trading preferences. Credit Suisse cross finder dark pool fined the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company just put their order on the exchange theres so much leakage that the spread moves. Best way to minimize that leakage is to hide it in dark pool. Need to spread on all avenues. Min quantity on all orders prevents against pinging. Conditional is that I&amp;rsquo;ll accept this order if everything else is not filled. Buy side evolution against back-running. HFTs are smartest people in the room who use all the rules to get the biggest benefit. The rules can be bent to hft benefits which is annoying and has happened on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules in canada: proprietary cannot trade against orders with less than 5000 shares. Firms like TD made routing protocols to ensure retail got best execution. The routing would know where the other orders are going. This would avoid the ATS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash boys shined a light on the plumbing and gets annoyed at people having errors in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firms were using the tape compared to the feed from the exchange. The hero was Brad and Ronin. Typical Michael Lewis 60mins. First chapter was leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who read that book didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was happening. Everyone then wanted to understand market structure. Needed someone in Canada. Got to meet head traders of other firms. TD plays a big part in that book. TD Ameritrade. Sold to Schwab and td owns 10% of Schwab. Chris Snaggy made arrangements with wholesalers for the order flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers receive lots of market orders. Limit orders rest on an exchange. Market orders go to a wholesaler who price improves on the best bid or offer. Very small price improvement. Hard to back up the fact that the price improvement is significant. Ameritrade advertising is percent orders that get price improved. Broker gets that rebate check which is a payment for order flow. In any other industry it would be called a kick back. Uninformed retail means that both sides get action. Institutions segmented out. Non centralized trading which helps with price discovery and capital formation. Instead he thinks best execution should be to always search for the best price rather than routing to wholesaler. Each order should receive best execution and people took responsibility to do that. Retail missed dark pool orders. If RobinHood got cut out by wholesalers they&amp;rsquo;d be screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail is having it too good. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay the infrastructure to interact. 16 exchanges and 40 seek pools is stupid. Should just be one. Too much redundancy. Regulations don&amp;rsquo;t want NASDAQ collusion from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nyse market glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron ruling. Handcuffs agencies from creating rules that aren&amp;rsquo;t codified in Congress. Chevron says  agency is the expert when the law isn&amp;rsquo;t clear on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian market structure. Overnight trading happens in south Korea. 22% of leverage ETFs is in Korea.
Us ATS: BlueOcean ats. 8am-4pm. 24 hour trading is so bad but it&amp;rsquo;s coming from crypto trading and everything. TD Ameritrade started this on 24 symbols as an ad in SuperBowl. In 2023, RobinHood and IBKR decided to allow all symbols. For these 24 symbols, there&amp;rsquo;s a popping futures market. Therefore, the price inference was good enough for price discovery rather than the other symbols which would be the price discovery during the overnight hours. Transactions that occur from 8pm - 11:59pm aren&amp;rsquo;t recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail order. Parent and child order until GameStop, roaring kitty, and Reddit. If so many people bought GameStop the wholesaler got rolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia contributed to 15% of world returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constellation executive sold before capital gains tax hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against zero commission trading because retail just trades without spending some time thinking about of a cost-benefit. Gamestop results in destabilization, short-sellers, and results in losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clara Furse, new chief executive, rejected it (undervalued)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although board still in agreement, hedge funds caught wind of acquisition talks and acquired from below 5% to well over 30% and taken lead in opposing the bid, demanding a dividend rollup instead&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 1993, holding company to amalgamate Frankfurt&amp;rsquo;s exchange and securities depository (a securities depository is a book keeper of the shares without needing to physically transfer shares).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founding CEO Ruddier Von Rosen brought together all eight regional exchanges (Deutsche TerminBörse (DTB), Germany’s futures and options market, the country’s clearing organization and a data processing company).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange &amp;ldquo;run more like an electrical utility than a financial outfit.&amp;rdquo; In 1993, Frankfurt had tiny market capitalization of its listings (as a percentage of GDP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, the three biggest exchanges (Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover and Stuttgart) were still quoting their own prices instead of moving from trading on the floor to computers as desired by the three biggest banks (which owned 30% of Borse). The differences in prices put off international investors and they turned to London&amp;rsquo;s SEAQ International, which offers big blocks of German company shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreigners complained that listing procedures were clumsy and expensive, and that the big banks (which in effect ran the Börse) favoured cash markets over derivatives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash market: investors receive shares immediately in exchange for cash. Basically the stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seifert wanted to develop computerised share trading system to cut costs and concentrate dealing in German equities currently spread over eight different exchanges. His aim to make trading in Deutschmark securities quicker and cheaper was nowhere easier to achieve than in Germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needed to compete and beat London at this, especially the block trading. American Electronic Trading Systems and NASDAQ were trying to break into European markets. Trade Point, for British equities, was about to open in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selling properties and cutting loss-making activities to finance (DM150 million or $76.7M euros?) the new trading system, Xetra (Zeetra) was launched in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pan-European stock exchange alliances were preferred to mergers, but Seifert felt that mergers would be the best way to cut costs. In 1998, Frankfurt and Swiss counterpart (SBF?) merged to form Eurex, which poached the majority share of business in German government bonds (Bund) from London&amp;rsquo;s Lifffe derivatives exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurex was a joint venture to create electronic trading and clearing platform for options, futures, and other derivatives contracts. They believed that exporting the tech to make it the world standard was essential, so they sold it to Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s stock exchange, and in-sources the operations of Vienna, Dublin, Helsinki, and Chicago. Other customers: Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the São Paulo Stock Exchange, Bovespa, and the Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearstream International, a specialist in clearing, settlement and custody of securities across borders, was created in 1999 as a merger between Deutsche Börse and Cedel (cross-border securities depo located in Luxembourg). Siefert acquired it for $1.4B in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1995 Seifert hired McKinsey, which he used to work for nine years. First wanted to create a European index with LSE, but failed because each had ties to their own competing indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Deutsche Börse wanted to rename itself as Euroboard and go public. Paris could not join in but French, Dutch, Belgian, Lisbon stock exchanges announced merging into Euronext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavin Casey of LSE approached Deutsche Börse offering full merger. Euronext proposed 50/50 merger, but LSE wanted Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Börse had the approval, LSE did not. OMX, Stockholm Stock Exchange, started hostile takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergies: Tech transfer, diversification coverage, cost savings; Two main synergies: cost savings and revenue synergies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cash bid, 23% above Friday closing price on LSE on 6 December 2004 (1.35 billion euros or $2.6B all cash no debt financing). Clara Furse&amp;rsquo;s rejection came within hours. Borse made more than 2x the profit as LSE. Worry of Frankfurt was low volume of equity trading, due to small quoted Germany companies and weak IPO market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSE was leading in low costs, and SEAQ avoided stamp duties on share deals (tax on share transfers). Market makers can quote two-way prices (bid-ask spread) for business in larger amount, so big blocks of stocks can be fed only when a counterpart exists. In 2004, LSE had 293 IPOs, or 80% of Western Europe. Mostly cash market, but derivatives is where the volume growth and higher revenues would come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy of the merger. Frank Hartmann:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of costs is particularly sensitive for British investors who have been pressing the London exchange to lower its transaction fees. &amp;ldquo;When you are looking at infrastructures coming together, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a question of price,&amp;rdquo; said Ms. Knight at the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers in London. &amp;ldquo;We are going to be looking at the cost benefits and how it&amp;rsquo;s going to develop strategically&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;target company being acquired goes up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;acquirer loses value, about 3% on average&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquirer tends to overpay&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New academic study to understand the long term affects of mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully price the long-term effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 2006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with measuring over 3 years, is the other strategies of the business, which might not be merger related&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer you wait, the fuzzier the causation effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 years is long, so hard to believe it&amp;rsquo;s about the merger effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you just look at mergers, companies that merged lost value over the next three years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking at failed mergers (regulatory, exogenous): companies that want to buy but don&amp;rsquo;t succeed. Those companies ended up performing even worse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, mergers likely to create value (slows down loss of value)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also tells us companies that are looking to merge are already on the decline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large cash balance, tends to be misused. If firms have large cash balances, it&amp;rsquo;s not because of great projects to invest in, but rather the firm has nothing to invest in and is value destructive. Firms with large cash balances are un-liked.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2004, Deutsche Börse shares underperformed the DAX index, and hedge funds like: Children&amp;rsquo;s Investment Fund (TCI) in London, Atticus Capital in New York, and RIT Partners (Lord Rothschild) began buying in late autumn. RIT Partners sent Lord Rothschild to oppose the LSE bid and his son was part of Atticus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCI managing partner Christopher Hohn warned against the bid as the bid was for 25 times earnings whereas Deutsche Börse was trading at 9. Board supervisory chairman Rolph Breuer was also head of Deutsche Bank&amp;rsquo;s supervisory board which owned 6.8% of LSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the deal was proposed, TCI and Atticus bought heavily to own 12% of the company. &amp;ldquo;Stock was undervalued, poor corporate governance.&amp;rdquo; Ironic since Deutsche Börse was ranked second among all DAX on the 2005 survey of governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCI wanted a shareholder vote, but Seifert insisted that German corporate law did not dictate that the takeovers needed a shareholder meeting. Only a change in corporation’s articles of association would require a shareholder meeting, or vastly different business acquisition. Also the maximum price would have to be shared. The fund wanted Deutsche Börse to buyback shares and return money to shareholders. Deutsche Börse was the only AA- company in Germany even after the share buy-back was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By February 2005, Deutsche Börse price went up by 27% and executives were hoping the hedge funds would have sold but TCI began garnering support from Fidelity (10%) and Merrill Lynch (3-4%) and increased their own stake to 7.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, a minority shareholder needs to hold a required 5% of shares for only three months to demand a shareholders&amp;rsquo; meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of losing in the meeting, Seifert announced a dividend and buy-back programme by the end of 2007 and withdrew the offer on March 6th 2005. Debt-equity ratio went down from 12 to 9% in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/resource/blob/308024/9d1b5172aebccb5cb4360b8296074c00/data/konzernbilanz-2005_en.pdf&#34;&gt;2005 balance sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds tried to remove supervisor board, and although the discharge vote had a 68% approval rating, TCI had dropped the proposal two days before AGM. Three board members resigned, including Breuer and Seifert who left the company immediately. Reto Francioni became the new CEO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 9 August 2005 the Börse’s shares went up 2.79% to €73.72, an increase of 22% since the ousting of Seifert in May, with investors welcoming signs of a more streamlined strategy underpinned by a share buy-back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BaFin, Germany&amp;rsquo;s financial sector supervisory board, had affirmed that certain shareholders acted in concert. The board did not properly represent the overseas shareholders. 21 board members, a third were employee representatives, and the reset were owned by Germany&amp;rsquo;s largest financial institutions; Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, HVB and Dresdner Bank. Such characteristic ties were not uncommon in German boardrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a pan-European merger took place, which regulator would supervise the combined exchange (Euronext, The Swedish OM Group, the Australian bank Macquarie, and even the Nasdaq were rumoured to be interested)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain’s Financial Services Authority would not easily give up oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the second time Hohn has been linked with such a vote. In May, a company associated with TCI called for a vote on the principal of a European merger, which failed in favour of a &amp;ldquo;merger of equals&amp;rdquo; agreement with the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hohn wanted to merge with Deutsche Börse instead, probably because he owned both companies and the amalgamation would be a quasi-monopoly with higher derivatives trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest Euronext shareholder is hedge fund The Children&amp;rsquo;s Investment Fund Management, with 8.5%, according to shareholder register Citywatch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge funds were warned then to &amp;ldquo;respect management&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to determine and implement the strategy of the company&amp;rdquo; or risk having their voting rights revoked, two people familiar with the matter said.

&lt;p&gt;Then Deutsche Börse raised bid to 8.6 billion euros but NYSE Group and Euronext penned the merger agreement regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Börse still tried to merge in 2008 and 2009 with NYSE Euronext to create the largest exchange in history but was blocked by European Commission on the grounds that the resulting company would have a quasi-monopoly (90% volume) in the European financial derivatives traded globally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Stock Exchange is now worth about twice Deutsche Börse&amp;rsquo;s offer last year, at £2.57 billion ($4.81 billion), and Nasdaq has purchased enough of a stake in the London market to make it tough for anyone else to take it over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators threatened to revoke the rights of the activist investors. The cash distributions reduced Deutsche Börse&amp;rsquo;s ability to bid for Euronext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, the London Stock Exchange Group is worth 51.4B pounds or 60.86B euros and Deutsche Börse is worth 36.83B euros. The merger would&amp;rsquo;ve been very successful given the power of hindsight. Even with a yield of 2%, that&amp;rsquo;s an additional 14.72B or 51.55B euros. LSEG used to be smaller, but now is bigger or basically equal. By withdrawing the bid offer, Nasdaq was able to take a bigger stake and the stock price decimated the offer of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two-thirds of cases, activist hedge funds propositions regarding strategy, operations, and financial are partially or fully successful. Hedge funds are non-confrontational and the return on activism announcements is approximately 7% in a year without reversals. Target firms experience increases in payout, operating performance, and higher CEO turnover after activism (+10%) and lower CEO pay (~$1M).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike mutual funds and pensions, Hedge Fund activism comes with influence over the corporate board and management. This is because of HF managers have less regulation over capital and high incentives which also means high concentration in a smaller basket of companies. Hedge funds target value firms with low market value relative to book value, and are profitable with sound operating cash flows and return on assets. Target companies have lower payouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostile takeovers (hostility includes a threatened or actual proxy contest, takeover, lawsuit, or public campaign that is openly confrontational) is less than 30% of cases. They are not short-term holders and they do not seek control. Average 9.1% and up to 31.5% stake. Reliance on management cooperation or shareholder cooperation, which is why high institutional holding and analyst coverage stocks are targets. Hedge funds often coordinate (22% of cases, by filing Schedule 13Ds) or act in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns depends on the actual activism not just stock picking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;efficient capital redeployment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plants that were sold had lower productivity but experience greater improvement in the hands of the new owner and its best if the hedge fund is invovled&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clear V-shape correlating with year of targeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three years after intervension, the firm is outperfoming its previous pre-activism levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opponents think that hedge funds are short-term focused or only do financial engineering and deny real term value creation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such as extracting payouts to shareholders through leverage (lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hedge funds have a two year holding period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within two years of activist intervension, close to 26% are delisted or acquired which is twice the normal attrition rate of Compustat. Previous research was not able to account for this potential surviorship bias whereas this research looks at the performance of plants which still exist regardless of if the company was acquired or delisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To dismiss claims that hedge funds were just scoping out companies on the right path already, focus was on confrontational activism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To refute stock picking, performance of plants that belong to target firms’ non-primary business segments were examined
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stock picking would only look at company&amp;rsquo;s that are about to perform well due to their primary business not their non-primary business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also looked at firms that switched from filing 13G (passive) to 13D (activist stance) which means that there should&amp;rsquo;ve been no additional performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional tests refute alternative explanations that attribute the improvement to management’s voluntary reform, industry consolidation shocks, and hedge funds’ stock picking. The overall evidence is consistent with a real long-term effect of hedge fund intervention on target firms’ fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Government put a cap on rebates at 30 mill&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In early 2021 DTCC, a clear housing, called RobinHood to increase collatoral ($3.5B)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RobinHood couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the money, so had to halt purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retailers think its a conspiracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTCC asked collatoral because a lot of traders were trading on margin, which means that the Broker should be backing the purchase, not the trader who could go bankrupt if the stock goes down. DTCC doesn&amp;rsquo;t want RobinHood to go bankrupt to relieve itself of the share obligation. With t + 2 settlement, 10% collatoral, however with voltailte stocks, the voltaility was increased to 100%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DTCC is liable if RobinHood goes bankrupt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of Robin Hood investors were trading on margin and many of them used previous purchases of GameStop as collateral. Billions of dollars was potentially in-loans. DTCC was worried about volatility of GameStop and if it comes down, the margin loans might default, which might bankrupt RobinHood, which means that DTCC would be on the hook for the trades as it is expecting RobinHood to front the cash for the shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorts are good for the market, however it was found that short sellers ride the bubble before shorting the stock&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In insider traders, people who aren&amp;rsquo;t part of the company but are providing services, they are called temporary insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you overhear something and you don&amp;rsquo;t know the person, then you can trade on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some professions, there is no fiduciary duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a opaque/long chain of tipping, it&amp;rsquo;s not insider trading because it&amp;rsquo;s no really possible to tell if the information is from legal or illegall sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is a mining corporation focused on extracting sedimentary lithium from &lt;a href=&#34;https://lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/overview/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Thacker Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;The largest known &lt;strong&gt;Measured&lt;/strong&gt; and Indicated Resource in North America.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;TSX:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nyse.com/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;NYSE:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: $ is in the USD denomination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Lithium Americas announced a share issuance of 55,000,000 shares for a total of 250,000,000 ($5/share). The first part values the company using efficient market hypothesis. The second part is a quasi-dividend discount model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Efficient Market Hypothesis

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair price of $4.97. Upside of 30 cents of 8% on top of required rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Before Announcement = $6.66
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding before = 162.16M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Market Cap Before = $6.66 * 162.16 = 1,080M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares added = 55M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding present = 217.16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Ceteris Paribus = $4.97
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upside 0.37 cents per share or 8% based on recent after close pricing.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary: This is more of a question on whether the market will figure out that LAC is trading at a discount. I remember when PBR dropped 11%+ and it came back up for the dividend. I sold it before the CEO was replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Future Dividend Distributions
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is fairly valued at [4.43, 4.9] using conservative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough valuation was done using conservative assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;192.9 Mega ton of proven reserves equivalent to 3.3 mega tons of Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price per ton: US $5,400
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the Thacker Pass is operational, selling at a price higher than this lower bound will draw returns over 10% on the investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful life: 40 years
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although production will be smaller in the earlier years and double in the later years, we will assume a smoothened annuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mining net profit margin = 7%
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net profit margins vary between the years and can be as high as 20% or as low as -7%. Better to pick a number that makes sense in the long-term. 7% could be an over-estimate, but if mining corporations were known to have low net profit margins, the market would be valuing it a significantly less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount rate of 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Annuity = 3.3 * 1000000 * 5400 * 0.07 / 40 = $31,185,000 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the annuity formula, we get a present value of 304,959,697. The PV is a year before the plant becomes operational. We will assume 2025, but the longer it takes, the longer we will under-perform the  market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add back Net Tangible Assets of 407,462,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus the Cash infusion of $250,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair Value = 712,421,697 + 250,000,000
= 962,421,697&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided by shares outstanding of 217.16M and we get US $4.43, which is only 4% less than the last price of $4.60 and 6% less than the last closing price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fair value price at the end of the year is higher than the current price, the current price is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EMH, LAC is a buy. After a valuation, the risk is if Phase 1 will be passed, which is likely given the $250,000,000 cash infusion. Since the stock is valued fairly using safe assumptions, LAC is a buy for risk-seekers. For the risk-averse, fair-value without profits can never be a buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;double-declining-balance&#34; &gt;Double Declining Balance
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#double-declining-balance&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depreciate each year by a percentage of the carrying value that is equal to double the straight line percentage. So if the useful life is X, the double declining balance would mean a depreciation expense equal to Carrying Value * (2 / X). In the last year, depreciate directly to the salvage value instead of multiplying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portfolio of Lathes are purchased for $10,000. The Lathe&amp;rsquo;s have a useful life of 10 years and will be depreciated using the double declining method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;units-used&#34; &gt;Units Used
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#units-used&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second easiest depreciation method to memorize. If a machine is rated to have a life of 40,000 hours, depreciate based on the number of hours used. I remember using this practice mostly in managerial accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a Lathe was purchased for $100,000, has a residual value of $1,000 (scrap), and is rated for 40,000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 10,000 hours were logged on the machine. What is the journal entry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$99,000 for 40,000 hours. Therefore 10,000 hours is equivalent to $24,750 of depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-accounting&#34; data-lang=&#34;accounting&#34;&gt;Dr. Depreciation Expense $24,750
  Cr. Accumulated Depreciation - Equipment $24,750
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sum-of-the-years-digits-depreciation&#34; &gt;Sum-of-the-years&amp;rsquo;-digits Depreciation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sum-of-the-years-digits-depreciation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An accelerated method of depreciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if the estimated useful life is 10 years, the sum of the years&amp;rsquo; digits are 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 55&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The depreciation rate in the first year is 10/55, in the second year is 9/55, …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;capital-cost-of-allowance&#34; &gt;Capital Cost of Allowance
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#capital-cost-of-allowance&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not a depreciation method, in Canada, CCA and depreciation are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRcpnM26nJM&#34;&gt;interlinked&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, we will quickly go over tax bases, assets, and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has implemented software for CCA for T2 corporate tax returns, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more complicated than the formula I&amp;rsquo;ve linked below. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s many different classes, and in the future, the acceleration (1.5x) might be phased out. There&amp;rsquo;s also immediate expensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details of income taxes, you can read these two sections in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-397&#34;&gt;Intermediate Accounting II notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my notes, the tax base is the amount that is yet to be deducted for tax purposes. So when the tax base and the carrying value defer, we need to recognize on the income statement that in the future, there will be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more taxes to pay (carrying value &amp;gt; tax base)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. deferred tax expense
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increases the income tax expense line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cr. tax liability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less taxes to pay (carrying value &amp;lt; tax base)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cr. deferred tax benefit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decreases the income tax expense line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. tax asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key point from a finance perspective is that a corporation might be fairly valued from an EPS point of view, but under valued from a cash flow point of view since deferred taxes are not discounted. So if a corporation reports a deferred tax expense, an arbitrage opportunity - although small - might exist. BUt that&amp;rsquo;s just my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Excel FILTER Formula on Table Excluding Headers</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/excel-filter-table-excluding-headers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 11:30:07 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/excel-filter-table-excluding-headers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enter a variant of the formula below where Table1 is the name of the table (Ctrl + T to create tables in Excel). Since we are using a formula in another sheet, it might be prudent to place this on row 3 to make room for custom headers on row 1 and custom data (or another filter) on row 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-excel&#34; data-lang=&#34;excel&#34;&gt;# Enter this in A5
=FILTER(Table1[Stock]:Table1[Status],NOT(ISBLANK(Table1[Status])))
# Enter this in C5 or the width of the first formula + 1
=FILTER(Table1[Speculation]&amp;amp;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;,NOT(ISBLANK(Table1[Status])))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason there are two formulas is because empty cells show up as &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; by filter, so if we need spill-overs, we need to use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; modifier on each array separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of Table1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Stock&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Speculation&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;DOLLARAMA INC. (XTSE:DOL)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;HOLD&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Possibly over-valued&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;DOL&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (XTSE:CP)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BUY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;CP&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Vale SA (XNYS:VALE)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;VALE&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;ABBVIE INC. (XNYS:ABBV)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BUY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;ABBV&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;PROSPECT CAPITAL CORPORATION (XNAS:PSEC)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;PSEC&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;THE BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA (XTSE:BNS)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BUY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BNS&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;WHITEHORSE FINANCE, INC. (XNAS:WHF)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;WHF&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;STELLUS CAPITAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION (XNYS:SCM)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BUY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;SCM&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY (XNAS:LAMR)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;LAMR&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;NEXTERA ENERGY PARTNERS UNT (XNYS:NEP)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BUY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;NEP&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK (XTSE:TD)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;TD&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I used the formula on Table1, I got the following table. Notice that the data excludes any headers and only includes the wanted columns that had a Status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

      <title>Retail Investors Are Stupid</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/retail-investors-are-stupid/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 22:25:52 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/retail-investors-are-stupid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please repeat after me. Efficient Market Hypothesis does not mean stocks are valued fairly. It just means that stock prices reflect the latest news that is parsable by algorithms or is being parsed by many, and I mean many, decision making humans. So a news piece that is very obscure, like a journalist on Twitter is not going to have an impact on the markets unless it goes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/eli-lilly-hit-new-twitter-blue-fake-account-forced-apologize-over-free-insulin-tweet&#34;&gt;viral (fake news example)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have we learned? That the market is a monolith where stock prices reflect the majority shared opine. So if most people are stupid and believe everything they read on the internet or buy stocks based on the same feelings (e.g. I shop at Costco, Costco is always packed, Costco stock will always go up). Obviously, with Costco, it&amp;rsquo;s a 300B+ company that isn&amp;rsquo;t correcting anytime soon. Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example of &amp;ldquo;the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-is-y-not&#34; &gt;The Future is Y. NOT

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic gave everyone messiah vision. Zoom is the future, Purple Mattress is the future. Everyone will be purchasing Pelotons (my family replaced our broken treadmill with some generic one). When people start claiming companies are the future, they are making a claim that these stocks should be growing almost at 100% year on year. Now what is the difference between a stock that is definitely growing 100% yoy and a stock that is priced at that growth? Past-history and future timeline. Past-history, as in the company already existed and was already known (e.g. CELH). When the pandemic first hit, we all knew the lockdown was temporary. There&amp;rsquo;s no way staying in doors for 5 years was a viable solution. 2 years max. Therefore, stocks like ZM and PTON are temporary high growth stocks and should be bought (if at all) with the expectation to sell once the price has run up. Greed makes it hard to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so why do we care. If we sit out, we miss out. FOMO is a real thing right? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a FOMO, you also have to time your sells. Based on these stocks, people might get scared for an entire month, so while owning these stocks, keep in mind they are &lt;strong&gt;temporary&lt;/strong&gt; so best way to play these stocks is with a trailing stop loss of 20%, and when this trailing stop loss is executed DO NOT PURCHASE THE STOCK AGAIN. The 20% trailing stop loss is not a guarantee that the stock has hit it&amp;rsquo;s peak and is on its way down, but it limits your exposure before you are trapped in a situation where no one else is buying into the company and people are starting to take profit. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of stocks where a 20% trailing loss could prevent further losses. If you do buy at the peak; a 20% loss in capital should signal to purchase a well-tested stock (e.g. tech company) or ETF (VOO / ITOT / VUN.TO, QQQ / QQQ-C.TO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not short the companies either. The goal is to make money; invest according to the most probable scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new herd stock spotted in the wild is most likely to keep going up with maybe a hiccup or two and then it will pop and go down either very quickly or over time with hiccups. An old herd stock could go up for a very long time before popping to a &lt;strong&gt;fair valuation&lt;/strong&gt;. The difference between an old and a new herd stock is that the old herd stock at least has a fundamental value, so a re-entry at that valuation is fine. P/E is a horrible valuation; PEG is better as it accounts for earnings growth (though I wish there was a metric that used PEG and tangible book value for companies that keep billions in cash). So with these old herds, it&amp;rsquo;s best to have a set ratio that is ideal and the market kind of conforms to implicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if the stock would be added to the S&amp;amp;P500 if it suddenly went to a higher market cap and is profitable? If not, it&amp;rsquo;s a new herd stock, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s an old herd stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with old-herd versus the new herd is that the returns are front-loaded and so the company performance has to catch up to the valuation whereas with new herd the valuation is so ridiculously high that logic will force the valuation to catch up with the fundamentals (reality).&lt;/p&gt;

No one talks about this stock anymore. &amp;ldquo;direct to consumer is the future.&amp;rdquo; Nope, in-store has been here even when the internet took off and even when Amazon took off. Plus a mattress? Advertising would replace the cut to the wholesaler, and even then, customers have to trust the product versus trying something more affordable in a market that has existed for centuries, probably millenniums. It&amp;rsquo;s like investing in a laptop OEM because they only sell directly to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no idea this was a pandemic stock but I guess it makes sense considering I also bought stuff on their site. The fact that people found out about wayfair in such a short time once the pandemic hits astounds me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be classified as an old herd stock. Therefore, it was a good company before, but it also got the pandemic craze which can&amp;rsquo;t wear off due to it being the largest of all the pre-pandemic stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people believe in Elon Musk; people look at him as if he is Tony Stark
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think Tesla Roadster and Model S is where I caught wind of him
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember wanting a Tesla Model S in high school; so 2016 onwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20210210212336/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/spacex-falcon-heavy-tesla-roadster-orbit-earth-sun-space/&#34;&gt;Tesla Roadster in Space February 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla was overvalued? pre-pandemic ($60B in November 2019 and $117B in January 2020)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock was already so pumped which is why it withstood the pandemic wear-off by being large enough to be added into the S&amp;amp;P500. It was overvalued before, then it was overvalued before December 2020, and then it got added into teh S&amp;amp;P500 meaning that S&amp;amp;P500 ETF managers had to purchase it and will keep purchasing it. At this point, unless Tesla suddenly becomes unpopular, the bleed will take forever before Tesla is valued fairly. Fair value is most likely $124 (-31%) or $400B market cap (assuming no competitors do not eat Tesla&amp;rsquo;s market share) which is lower than the market cap in December 2020. Given a 20% year on year expected growth from then, we should expect Tesla to be fairly valued in 2027-2029.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, make money off the S&amp;amp;P500 inclusion. No, don&amp;rsquo;t actually think that Tesla is more than EVs. It got big because of EVs and Elon Musk, it can&amp;rsquo;t stay big forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called her the modern Peter Lynch; she was the complete opposite. ARKK is below pre-pandemic levels. The only reason this ETF went up in the first first place was due to owning TSLA when it&amp;rsquo;s price blew up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part of the pandemic was the cheap equity capital that got taken advantage by corporations abusing securities rules and going public through reverse mergers in order to skirt off regulations. Investors get completely misled, and projections went down the toilet for sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing a more concrete article about why SPACs should be banned in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Investment Portfolio Strategies</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/novel-investment-portfolio-strategies/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is about active management, although a more important question to answer is &lt;strong&gt;how to find&lt;/strong&gt; stocks that have the opportunity to generate alpha. For Passive ETF Investing, read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market#passive-etf-Investing&#34;&gt;How to invest in the stock market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about portfolio weighting, there&amp;rsquo;s usually only three that people are taught: market capitalization, price, equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is ideal? We know price is not ideal because it&amp;rsquo;s based on the share price which is determined by the shares outstanding. With market price and equal weight, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit harder. Usually equal weight is better, but clearly, the top stocks (tech) of the S&amp;amp;P500 has made the market weighted index outperform the equal weighted index. Therefore, we need an equal weighted portfolio where the weight of the heavy weights are bigger than if they were in the SP500 market-weighted index. We need a way to trim the world stock market into just a few stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick 20-25 stocks across industries to reduce risk to systemic levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since mid-cap outperforms large cap and small-cap is high risk, make sure that the basket is something like 80% mid-caps, 10% large-caps, 10% small cap ETF (invest in all small caps or pick no more than 2-3 that are definitely undervalued)&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;2-3 (~10%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rough estimate on the allocations, however, I think my own portfolio is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to maximize returns is to focus on Mature-Growth and Value stocks and speculating on growth stocks. A growth stock is a company that is losing money but is growing at 10%+ yoy in revenues. A Mature-Growth is similar but is profitable (i.e. profit grows). A Mature company does not grow profits; usually pays dividends. A Value is company is any one of these (not growth), which in fundamentally undervalued in the most likely scenario of &amp;ldquo;business as usual.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that write down the assumptions of the market that the stock price reflects, ask yourself if those assumptions are wrong in a favourable manner, and if so, that is a value stock. An example is PayPal. PayPal is priced to die in 20 years. PayPal has been alive for 20 years during which time even crypto did not replace PayPal. PayPal is not just a payment provider but also a processor (Stripe is just a processor). Therefore, PayPal has value beyond 20 years of being a payment method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weights are (1 - market-cap weight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy: smaller &lt;strong&gt;mid-cap&lt;/strong&gt; stocks have more growth potential (and thus higher returns when in a basket) than larger companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not re-balance until new stocks are added, and even then re-balance from largest-cap and overweight to the new stock. Never profit take since the strategy relies on betting on the small ones which will keep winning until they are big enough to take profit&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy A: pick stocks based on positive-driven Beta for stocks that are recessionary proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy B: pick stocks based on Beta&amp;rsquo;s with time horizons that are more in line with investment time horizons (include recency bias if doing en-masse). Then, you take advantage of stocks that report higher Beta&amp;rsquo;s than what you calculated.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>CAPM is not a Good Cost of Equity [DCF, WACC]</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;capm-assumptions-are-not-true&#34; &gt;CAPM Assumptions are Not True
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#capm-assumptions-are-not-true&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One assumption of CAPM is that there is a single holding period for everyone. WRONG. Boomers exist and I want to make enough money to put it into dividend stocks. Therefore, a good model is based on each individual and we are not at the point of churning out models based on individual preferences or generalizing what most investors follow. Let me give you a tip. Most investors, people, don&amp;rsquo;t know what the hell CAPM is. The second assumption is no taxes. This one is okay. Bad since corporate taxes do exist and are a lot, okay because registered accounts exist where investors with thousands of dollars can earn money without pay taxes on capital gains or dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#inspiration-for-this-post&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read a Reddit post of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1area1r/&#34;&gt;DCF Analysis on GOOGL&lt;/a&gt; where the cost of equity for Alphabet was &amp;ldquo;calculated&amp;rdquo; to be 9% using CAPM where a risk premium was 4.6% (source is one professor and this is apparently on the low end of the range 4.5 - 5.5% of all models according to  Tim Koller of Wharton), and the Beta is 1.06 (source is yahoo). This seemed odd to me because GOOGL is a tech stock and one that performs well. 20% annual compound rate of return for 5 years, and 16% for 10 years. In my eyes, the expected rate of return for GOOGL is 16% annually as that is what investors have been receiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ke---required-rate-of-return&#34; &gt;k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =  Required Rate of Return
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ke---required-rate-of-return&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire point of discounted cash flow model valuation is to use a required rate of return for the equity investor. In the case of us, we want 10-20%. If we wanted 10%, we should just take debt and put it into the market and get a nice 5% bonus return&amp;hellip;That&amp;rsquo;s called a risk-adjusted return. Trusting a cost of equity is like saying investors know what they are doing. No they don&amp;rsquo;t. No &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t. So then I say, let&amp;rsquo;s just use a cost of equity for people like me who seek alpha. We want to buy relatively undervalued companies that can grow at 20%+ with high probability somewhere down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s why I am bullish on GOOGL. They operate Google Search Engine, the best search engine which gives websites and real live data. That is not going to be replaced by perplexity nor by openai because when I want to read stuff, not just a summary.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence and finance should go hand in hand but we find that it is the complete opposite when it comes to the stock market. We need to realize that an IQ of 100 is really really dumb. Why do I say that? Because I go to university and I see the kinds of people here, and I see the kinds of people in Computer Science itself. I recently passed a tutorial where the average was 50% and I got a 92% after a 5% late penalty (due to submitting incorrectly). If the average IQ is 124 in CS and the average mark for a CS test is 50%, it&amp;rsquo;s almost as if an average IQ of 124 is just the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the average IQ of an investor is also 100. Not to mention IQ has nothing to do with returns. IQ just means capability. You still need to apply IQ to gain an advantage. Research takes time and IQ reduces the time it takes to make decisions. Anyways thanks for attending my ramble of the day. Wasted hours on this, but mostly because my midterm went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Return = Risk Free + Risk Premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk can be transferred for a price. One sufficient manner is through the use of derivatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hedging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locking in arbitrage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing nature of a liability
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed rate loan and you want to change that into a variable one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can either pay back the loan and take a variable rate (transaction costs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you can use a derivate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the nature of an investment without incurring the costs of selling one portfolio and buying another
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something about using a forwards contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agreement to buy or sell underlying asset at some point in the future for a certain price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spot contract is buying or selling immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example. Spot price of $100, risk-free of 5%, Expected price in a year is $110. F0 is 105 if there is no risk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling = short position. Buying = long position&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exchange traded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable to a wide variety of underlying assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specs need to be defined
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can be delivered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to deliver
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many futures contracts, the delivery period is the whole month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settled daily (mark to market)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closing out futures is easy, it&amp;rsquo;s just an opposite trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most contracts are closed out before maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When used for hedging, profits are not recorded for accounting purposes until the contract is closed (pg. 59). If not for hedging, then the books would note the gain/loss in the year end even if the contract will not be closed until the next year&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Margin is cash or marketable securities deposited by an investor with his or her broker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The balance in the margin account is adjusted to reflect daily settlement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin minimizes the possibility of a loss through a default on a contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail traders provide &lt;strong&gt;initial margin&lt;/strong&gt; and, when the balance in the margin account falls below a &lt;strong&gt;maintenance margin level&lt;/strong&gt;, they must provide variation margin bringing balance back up to initial margin level.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Example sold asset at spot price of 110 + shorted future at price of 105 - bought back future at price of 112 = 103&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta times value of the portfolio divided by value of one index futures contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1,000 S&amp;amp;P futures price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$5MM portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 Beta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One contract is $250 times the index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 * 5,000,000 / 250,000 = 30 contracts short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index level of 1,000. Future price of 1,010, 250x per contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio value of $5,050,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-free = 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend = 1% per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beta = 1.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 month horizon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future exit in 4 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.5 \* (5,050,000 / (250 * 1,010)) = 30 contracts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 3 months, index is at 900 and the future is at 902&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the net value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R = (P1 - P0 + D) / P0 = (P1 - P0) / P0 + D / P0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R = Rf + Beta (Rm - Rf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain from short position = &lt;code&gt;(1010 - 902) * 30 * 250= 810,000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Loss from index = (900 - 1000 + 1% * 1000 / 12 * 4) / 1000 = -97.5 / 1000 = -9.75%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rp = 4% / 4+ 1.5 (-0.0975 - 0.04 / 4) = -15.125%&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice that we divided risk free rate to account for 3 month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vp = 5,050,000 (1 - 15.125%) + 810,000 = 5,096,187.50&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Treasury rate is artificially low because Banks do not keep capital for Treasury instruments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OIS rates is a proxy for the risk-free rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose that in a U.S. three-month OIS the notional principal is $100 million and the fixed rate (i.e., the OIS rate) is 3% per annum. If the geometric average of overnight effective federal funds rates during the three months proves to be 2.8% per annum, the fixed rate payer has to pay 0.25 × (0.030 − 0.028) × $100,000,000 or $50,000 to the floating rate payer. (This calculation does not take account of the impact of day count conventions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OTC agreement that a certain LIBOR rate will apply to a certain principal during a certain future time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predetermined rate RK is exchanged for interest at the LIBOR rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FRA can be valued by assuming the forward LIBOR interest rate RF is certain to be realized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value = Present Value of the difference between the forward LIBOR interest rate (RF) and the interest paid at the FRA rate RK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(RF - RK) * Principal * length of the contract&lt;/code&gt; and then discount to 0 from T2 at the risk free rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case: floating rate payment in the future but you want to make sure you are paying a fixed rate

&lt;p&gt;A company has agreed that it will receive 4% on $100 million for 3 months starting in 3 years. The forward rate for the period between 3 and 3.25 years is 3%. The value of the contract to the company is +$250,000 discounted from time 3.25 years to time zero at the OIS rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(0.04 - 0.03) * 100_000_000 * 0.25 / (1.03^3.25) = 250_000 / (1.03 ^ 3.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose rate proves to be 4.5% (with quarterly compounding). The payoff is –$125,000 at the 3.25 year point. Often the FRA is settled at time 3 years for the present value of the known cash flow at time 3.25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-125_000 / (1 + (0.045 * 0.25)) = -123_609.39&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;6x9 FRA: starts in 6 months (180 days) and ends in 9 months (270 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: rate of 3.10% for 6x9. 3% right now. What is the fixed rate in the agreement?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1 + (0.031 * 0.75)) / (1 + 0.03 * 0.5) = (1 + R * 0.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RF = 3.251%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: 3 months have passed, and the rate has gone to 3.25% for 3 months and 3.3% for 6 months. what is the value of the FRA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1 + (0.033 * 0.5)) / (1 + 0.0325 * 0.25) = (1 + R * 0.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A financial manager needs to hedge against a possible decrease in short-term interest rates. He decides to hedge his risk exposure by going short on a 3X6 FRA that expires in 90 days and is based on a 90-day LIBOR. The current LIBOR spot rates are observed: 30-day 5.83%, 90-day 6.00%, 180-day 6.14% and 360-day 6.51%. What is the rate the manager would receive on this FRA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest paid on $1 for 180 days: 0.0614 * 0.5 = 0.0307&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest paid on $1 for 90 days: 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected interest paid on $1 from 3x6 (compounded from 90-day): (1.0307 / 1.015 - 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected interest rate for 3x6 (compounded from 90): (1.0307 / 1.015 - 1) / 0.25 = 6.19%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Market Segmentation: short, medium, and long rates determined independently of each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity Preference Theory: forward rates higher than expected future zero rate

&lt;li&gt;Even an airline ticket is a forward contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be a model/marketplace for this sort of thing for each airline and etc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forward contracts on investment assets that provide no income
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discount bills, bonds, stocks without dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forward contracts on investment assets that provide a known dividend yield
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coupon bonds, indices, currency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forward contracts on investment assets that provide a known cash income
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coupon bonds, indices&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all these equations, T is the time till maturity in years from the present. r is the continuous compounding rate for the period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first negotiated, a forward contract is worth 0 because neither party is actually paying for the contract to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later, when there is a contract with delivery price K and a contract with delivery price F0, we can show that the value of the contract is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long forward contract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f=(F_0-K)e^{-rT}&#34; alt=&#34;f=(F_0-K)e^{-rT}&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short forward contract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f=(K-F_0)e^{-rT}&#34; alt=&#34;f=(K-F_0)e^{-rT}&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this case, a rate of say 8% continuous compounding for 3 month period requires multiplying the rate by the months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cash Price = Quoted Price + Accrued Interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quoted price is flat price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invoice or total price paid is called the dirty price or cash price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Accrued Interest = Coupon * (days since last coupon / coupon period)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually count the days in the coupon period instead of dividing by two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-example&#34; data-lang=&#34;example&#34;&gt;A semi-annual coupon bond with 8% coupon rate
Days passed since last coupon payment is 30
Accrued interest = $80/2  * (30/182.5) = 6.58
coupon rate * par value * (days / 365)
Invoice = 990 (quoted) + 6.58 = $996.58

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each $100 face value of bond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Price received by short party = most recent settlement price * conversion factor + accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year Treasury note futures contract quotes are to the nearest half of a thirty-second (0.5/32ths). 127-015 means 127 + 1.5/32 and 90-08 means 90 + 8/32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-year and 2-year Treasury note contracts are quoted to nearest quarter of a thirty-second (0.25/32ths). 119-197 means 119 + 19.75 / 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement is priced on a 6% bond and delivery can be any bond with a maturity of more than 15 years but less
than 25 years. The conversion factor is unique to each bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each contract is delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds. Suppose recent settlement price is 90-00, there&amp;rsquo;s a conversion factor of 1.3800, and the accrued interest is $3 per $100 face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, (1.3800 × 90.00) + 3.00 = $127.20. Since $100,000 face value is delivered (x1000), the total cash received is $127,200.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoted price the bond would have on the first day of delivery month assuming interest rate is 6% with semi-annual compounding and the maturity is rounded down to a multiple of 3 months. If the maturity is not a multiple of 6 months, assume a coupon is paid in three months meaning that accrued interest of 3 months has to be subtracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first example of these rules, consider a 10% coupon bond with 20 years and two months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The first coupon payment is assumed to be made after six months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at six-month intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that the face value is $100. When the discount rate is 6% per annum with semiannual compounding (or 3% per six months), the value of the bond is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sum from i=1 to i=40 { 5/1.03^i } + 100 / 1.03^40 = 146.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divided by the face value to get a conversion factor of 1.4623&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider an 8% coupon bond with 18 years and 4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments back to a point in time three months from today at 6% per annum (compounded semiannually) gives a value of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 months from today, the value is 4 (for the last coupon?) + sum from i=1 to i=36 {4 / 1.03^i} + 100 / 1.03^36 = 125.83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounting to today is 125.83 / (1.03^0.5) = 123.99. Subtract the accrued interest of 2 (3/6 * 4) to get 121.99&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;115 quoted bond price, 12% coupon, conversion factor of 1.6, 60 days since last coupon payment, 122 till next coupon payment, 148 after that till contract Maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S0 is the CASH VALUE not the quoted value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S0 = 115 + (60/182) * 6 = 116.978&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I = 6e^(-0.1 * (122/365)) = 5.803&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F0 = (S0 - I)e^(rT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F0 = (116.987 - 5.803)e^(0.1 * (270/360)) = 119.211&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoted F0 = 119.711 - total accrued interest = 119.711 - 148/183 * 6 = 114.851&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we need to divide by the conversion factor to get 71.79&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OTC agreement to exchange cash flows in the future. Calculation usually involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or another market variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You agree to pay a fixed-rate and get paid back a floating rate (e.g. LIBOR or OIS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose Apple has an obligation to pay LIBOR + 0.1%. If they purchase a SWAP with CitiBank, they pay CitiBank a fixed rate, say 3%, and receive LIBOR. Therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s a fixed rate of 3.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can also convert a fixed rate to a floating if they think interest rates will come down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The benefit that needs to be split is: 120 - 70 = 50 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think: one corporation has to pay floating to the other, so calculate the fixed rate paid to each other which is the fixed rate + half the benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBBCorp borrows floating at +0.6% and pays fixed 4.35% and receives floating

&lt;li&gt;Pay 3% on a US dollar principal of 15,000,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receive 4% on a pound sterling principal of 10,000,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GE wants to borrow AUD
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current rates are 5% for USD and 7.6% for AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantas wants to borrow USD
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current rates are 7% for USD and 8% for AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefit is (2 - 0.4)  = 160 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, GE borrows USD at 5%, pays 8% for AUD and gets 6.2% in USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Quantas borrows AUD at 8%, pays 6.2% USD, and gets 8% AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 7.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swap 3% per annum and receives LIBOR every six months on $100million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swap has 15 months remaining (3, 9, 15)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate applicable to exchange in 3 months is 2.9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward LIBOR rates for 3-9 month period and 9-15 month periods are 3.429%, 3.734%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OIS zero rates are 2.8% for 3 months, 3.2% for 9 months, and 3.4% for 15 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Period&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;3 months&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;9 months&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;15 months&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;LIBOR&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2.9%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;~3.429%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;~3.734%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;PAY&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.5M&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.5M&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.5M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;RECEIVE&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.45&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.745&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.867&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Calculation&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2.9%/2 * 100&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;3.429%/2 * 100&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;3.734%/2 * 100&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discount by the OIS Rate using the continuous compounding formula (Pe^(-rT)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, value both cashflows as Bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of a swap, is the difference between what you receive and what you pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 7.3 and 7.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese interest rates are 1.5% per annum (continuous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USD interest rates are 2.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% yen, 4% dollars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principals are $10M and 1,200M yen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap lasts more than 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange rate is 110 yen per dollar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the PV of hte cashflows for each currency and then convert one to the other&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two options, call and a put, with same underlying asset, strike. maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what strike price would they have the same value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: graphically or using put-call parity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series of events where there are two possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock price is currently $20. In three months it will either be $22 or $18. Suppose call option has strike price 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta: shares long for every options shorted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value of the portfolio when short a call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;20 * delta - f&lt;/code&gt; where f is the value of the option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22, &lt;code&gt;22 * delta - 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 18, &lt;code&gt;18 * delta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;22*delta - 1 = 18 * delta&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;delta = 0.25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value in 3 months is 4.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;code&gt;4.5 * e^-( -0.12*0.25) = 4.367&lt;/code&gt; where risk-free rate is 12%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, 20(0.25) - f = 4.367 → f = 0.633&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk less when &lt;code&gt;Delta = (fu - fd) / (S0u - S0d)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f = (pfu + (1 - p)fd)e^(-rT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p = (e^(rt) - d) / (u - d)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Calculate the standard deviation, s, of the mu_i&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical volatility estimate is: \sigma \hat = s / (sqrt ( Tau))&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Find relationship of portfolio to index.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The portfolio return is the value that fell plus the pro-rated dividends that was received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then use this return to calculate the situational return on the index and subtract the dividend yield
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do do this use CAPM formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This nominal value on the index is the strike price we want to purchase of the put&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find number of puts to purchase
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put options to purchase to cover the initial portfolio: &lt;code&gt;Beta \* ValueOfPortfolio / (ValueOfIndex * 100)&lt;/code&gt; where values are the initial values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Delta = change in option price with relation to underlying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vega or Lambda: change in option price with relation to underlying implied volatility

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive for long puts and calls since if price goes up, delta will go up for call obviously, but also up for put since less short is needed in underlying&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we hold a short call position and hold delta shares, why are we doing so? When the underlying&amp;rsquo;s value goes up, we lose delta in the short call options, but we also gain on the underlying shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta on a european non-dividend call is N(d1)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;european non-dividend put: N(d1) - 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What position in option 1 and the underlying asset will make the portfolio delta and gamma neutral?  Answer: Long 10,000 options, short  6000 of the asset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What position in option 1 and the underlying asset will make the portfolio delta and vega neutral? Answer: Long 4000 options, short 2400 of the asset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What position in option 1, option 2, and the asset will make the portfolio  delta, gamma, and vega neutral?

&lt;li&gt;Starting in 2000, mortgage originators relaxed lending standards and created large subprime first mortgages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand for real estate and prices rose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% mortgage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teaser rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no income, no job, no assets (NINJAs), ARMs, teaser rates, liar loans, &lt;strong&gt;non-recourse borrowing&lt;/strong&gt; (repossession)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default correlation increase in stressed market conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovery rates are less in stressed market conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tranche with a certain rating cannot be equated with a bond with the same rating
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBB tranches used to create ABS CDOs were 1% wide nad had all or nothing distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not the same as the loss distribution for a BBB bond&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capital required to keep for the tranches was less than the mortgages themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mortgage originators: only cared about originating mortgages that can be securitized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuers: under pressure to provide high valuations to keep business&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my last co-op, I got to intern at Fiera Capital on their Private Debt team which manages $5B+ of investors. Within the first week, there are a lot of terms related not just to lending but even M&amp;amp;A that I had trouble figuring out the meaning. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article to make it easier to learn and understand finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;revolver-or-revolving-loan-debt-credit&#34; &gt;Revolver or Revolving (Loan, Debt, Credit)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#revolver-or-revolving-loan-debt-credit&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that there&amp;rsquo;s a max limit on how much the borrower can borrow and it can be repaid to free up the amount available to borrow. A credit card is an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accordion-loan&#34; &gt;Accordion Loan
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#accordion-loan&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agreement that the limit can be increased or that a term can be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fccr---fixed-charge-coverage-ratio&#34; &gt;FCCR - Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fccr---fixed-charge-coverage-ratio&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FCCR = (EBITDA minus taxes unfunded capex and distributions) / (Fixed Charges Before Tax including interest expense)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unfunded-capex&#34; &gt;Unfunded Capex
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#unfunded-capex&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfunded CAPEX = Net CAPEX - increase in long-term debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a lender&amp;rsquo;s point of view, when assets are sold, the capex does not decrease, unlike a DCF model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;distribution&#34; &gt;Distribution
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#distribution&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My broad definition is: Non operational cash outflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically this is defined in the legal contract with a lot of leeway. For example, some distributions might be salary related, so it is hard to make a court believe that the covenant was a legitimate if it was preventing management from earning a living (as ridiculous as it sounds, according to my co-worker at FPD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;leverage--total-funded-debt--ebitda&#34; &gt;Leverage = Total Funded Debt / EBITDA
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#leverage--total-funded-debt--ebitda&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;funded-debt&#34; &gt;Funded Debt
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#funded-debt&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded debt refers to all types of &lt;strong&gt;loans&lt;/strong&gt; provided by lenders. The reason &amp;ldquo;funded&amp;rdquo; is used, is because &amp;ldquo;debt&amp;rdquo; on its own implies all liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ebitda&#34; &gt;EBITDA
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ebitda&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This is the number used because taxes are usually a fraction of EBITDA, depreciation/amortzation are not cash values, and interest expense is what the private lender would get (assuming that the lender is &lt;em&gt;senior&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pro-forma-ebitda&#34; &gt;Pro-Forma EBITDA
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pro-forma-ebitda&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro-Forma means that the EBITDA is an estimate under a specific assumption or scenario. For example, the scenario is &amp;ldquo;loan injected.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normalized-ebitda&#34; &gt;Normalized EBITDA
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#normalized-ebitda&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Normalized EBITDA is the EBITDA we&amp;rsquo;d expect the firm to generate after adjustments including the remval of non-recurring expenses. When combined with Pro-Forma, previous recurring expenses might be expected to stop as well. For example an extra employee that would no longer be getting paid post-deal. Although this is what we expect a normalized EBITDA figure to be, the adjustments that were made need to be inspected because it&amp;rsquo;s possible the company did remove recurring expenses. An example of a normalized EBITDA would be a retailer of the company over ordering in one year and under ordering the next year. Such a situation would lead to a greater disparity between two years. So if there is evidence that the retailer over ordered, then a case for normalization may be made. A bad example of normalization is removing rent expense when there is a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-concern&#34; &gt;Going Concern
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#going-concern&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A going concern is that the company is not closing shop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;secured-loan-and-lien&#34; &gt;Secured Loan and Lien
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#secured-loan-and-lien&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secured means that the loan has collatoral. An example is a mortgage where the loan is secured on the home. A credit card is an unsecured loan. When an asset is secured, the term sheet may say something like &amp;ldquo;lender has first lien on accounts receivable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior, Junior Lender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior lender for a company is the lender that gets dibs usually on assets and is usually the longest tenured
or the biggest. It depends on the intercreditor agreement if there&amp;rsquo;s a few lenders and subscription agreement if there are many. A junior lender exists when there are at least two lenders and one is the senior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intercreditor-agreement&#34; &gt;Intercreditor Agreement
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#intercreditor-agreement&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intercreditor agreement is a custom agreement between lenders on the priority of payment and securitiy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subscription-agreement&#34; &gt;Subscription Agreement
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#subscription-agreement&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subscription agreement is an agreement between many lenders based on the same contract drafted by a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-ratio&#34; &gt;Current Ratio

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a prospectus by the company to the lender for the loan. It will generally have info about the company, an overview on its financials, and what they are asking for. Generally, just like with pitching to equity investors, companies will try to appear as squeeky clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discussion with the company about their CIM and a walk through of their internals, a PIM is drafted for review. This is a proposal for a deal to make. It needs to be reviewed by people higher up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the raw deal. The big one. This should be everything you need to know about the deal. The background info, the financials, the terms of the loan (including covenants), and the risks and mitigations. The risks and mitigations is the most important component because why else would the firm be coming to a private lender and not a bank which is cheaper. The money did not come out of thin air. It is the investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one instance (not at Fiera PD), a company was in the business of selling sonic boom devices that can be used to detect mining and minerals. The company stated that most of its revenue came from universities. What was not mentioned and was not stated as a risk by the account manager of the loan was that Oil &amp;amp; Gas companies were funding these research endeavers. When gas prices plummeted, revenue was cut by 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A financial covenant is basically a requirement for the company to not be considered in a default state (other than missing a payment). These covenants basically exist for insight into the performance of the company and a guage on how risk has changed. Covenants could be leverage based but obviously, each lender will have different risk appetite. To be in the private lending business, the risk appetite is obviously higher than bonds and banks, but might not be as high as individual equities. Investors are just looking to out perform the market on a long-term basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe this is when you agree to a purchase price of $500,000 and you only give $450,000 to the vendor. The $50,000 is a vendor take back which is a liability that is still payable. A VTB is an alternative to borrowing more from a lender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P-E ratio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is should be versus what it is.
Payout ratio over (ke – g).  Or (1- retention ratio) / (ke – g)

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable growth: based on what is retained, times the return on earnings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROE = Earnings / Book Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulative means that missed payments are still owed.
With non-cumulative preferred shares, company does not have to pay the missed payments ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares become voting at default payment to preferred shares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOW is &lt;strong&gt;price-weighted&lt;/strong&gt; (not value weighted) and it&amp;rsquo;s divisor accounts for stock-splits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price-weighted is where you take the sum of prices and divided it by a divisor (given)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the return of a price-weighted index is based of the index and not the individual returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A t-bill has a bank discount yield of 6.81% based on the ask price and 6.9% based on the bid price. The maturity of the bill is 60 days. Find the bid and ask prices of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert 6.81% and 6.9% for 60 days. 360 days in a year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1000 - 1000 * 0.0681 * 60 / 360 = 988.65&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1000 - 1000 * 0.069 * 60 / 360 = 988.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore the bid-ask spread is just $0.15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A u.s. treasury bill with 90-day maturity sells at a bank discount yield of 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. what is the price of the bill?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;c. what is the bond-equivalent yield of the bill?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d. what is the effective annual yield of the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. 1000 - 1000 * 0.03 * 90 / 360 = 992.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. 1000 / 992.5 - 1= 0.756%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. 365 days instead of 360: yield = 0.756% * 365 / 90 = 3.06%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchase 300 shares of GameStart at $40/share. Borrows $4,000 from her broker to
help pay for the purchase. Interest rate on loan is 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. What is the margin of Dei&amp;rsquo;s account when she first purchases the stock?
b. share price falls to $30 per share at year end, what is the remaining margin (equity)
on the account?
c. margin requirement is 30%, will a margin call occur?
d. What is the rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. (300 * 40 - 4,000) / 300 * 40 = (12,000 - 4,000) / 12,000 = 66.7%
b. 30 * 300 - 4,000 * 1.08 = 4,680
c. 4680 / 9000 = 52% &amp;gt; 30%, so no
d. (4680 - 8000) / 8000 = -41.50%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. What is remaining margin?
b. 30% margin requirement
c. rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Initial equity is 50% * 40,000 = 20,000.
Final equity is 20,000 + (40 - 50 - 2) * 1000 = 8,000
b. 8000 / (50 * 1000) = 16%, so yes

&lt;li&gt;An open-end fund has a net asset value of $10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of 6%. What is the offering price?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10.70 after offering price, so offering price = 10.70 / 0.094 = 11.38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering price is 12.30 with a front-end load of 5%. What is the NAV? NAV = 12.30 * 0.95 = $11.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You purchased 1,000 shares at $20 with a front-end load of 4%. Securities increased in value by 12%. There is a 1.2% expense ratio. What is the rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFF = 20 / 0.96 = 20.83&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final value = 20  * 1.12 * (1 - 0.012) = 22.13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate of return = 22.13 / 20.83 - 1 = 6.24%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loaded-up fund has an expense ratio of 1.75%. Economy Fund has a front-end load of 2% but an expense ratio of 0.25%. Assume rate of return is 6% before any fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LU = 1000 * 1.06 * (1 - 0.0175) = 1041.45 → 4.1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EF = 1000 * (1 - 0.98) * 1.06 * (1 - 0.0025) = 1036.20 → 3.62%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bank A: 4.58% APR, m = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank B: 4.5%, m = 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank C: APR if compound is 12?

&lt;li&gt;12 * (1.0458 ^ (1/12) - 1)  = 4.4867%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STD = sqrt(0.038) = 19.49%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a normal distribution, we can expect a return of 9.76% +- 19.49% 68% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk: likelihood of something happening and magnitude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STD gives us both the magnitude and the likelihood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at historical returns, and calculate the STD of those returns to get the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skewness: positively skewed means a tail on the right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurtosis: how normally distributed data is (fatness of the curve)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download monthly data for 5 years from yahoo finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep only date and adjusted Close columns. Adjusted close factors dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a column called r and use the formula (=X4/X3-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate average of the rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a column called variance and use the formula (=(X3 - $AVERAGE$RATE)^2)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or use the VAR formula in Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the variance which is the SUM of the column divided by the number of rates MINUS 1
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a sample, 1 is subtracted to remove the bias to the mean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Square root the variance to ge the standard deviation of the monthly return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can skip the manual calculations and use the VAR and STD formulas provide by Excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get the SKEW of the data by using the SKEW function on the returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually calculating the SKEW
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a column and instead of squaring the deviation, cube it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide by the number of rates MINUS 1, and then multiply by the standard deviation cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use =KURT to get the kurtosis of the rates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 is NORMAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lowe the Kurtosis the tighter in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a. what are the investment proportions in the minimum-variance portfolio
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the formula, we get wE =17.39% and wB = 82.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. what is the expected value and standard deviation of the minimum variance portfolio rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected return is then 13.39%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard deviation (square root of portfolio variance) is then 13.92% (the formula uses covariance)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;wB = 54.8%, wE = 45.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected rp = 15.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STD(rp) = 16.54%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you wanted to use the risk free?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected return of complete portfolio = 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected return of complete portfolio = wFrF + wPrP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14% = (1-wp)8% + wp15.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14% = 8% + wp (15.61% - 8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wp = (0.14 - 0.08) / (0.1561 - 0.08)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many researchers have used a market model to estimate abnormal returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rt = a + b * rmt + et&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rt: stock return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rmt: market rate of return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et: firm-specific events return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b: sensitivity to market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a: average rate of return if market returns 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et = rt - (a + brmt)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stock&amp;rsquo;s return over and above prediction based on broad market movements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected Return vs. Abnormal Return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the analyst has estimated that a = .05% and b = .8. On a day that the
market goes up by 1%, you would predict from Equation 11.1 that the stock should rise  by an expected value of .05% + .8 x 1% = .85%. If the stock actually rises by 2%, the analyst would infer that firm-specific news that day caused an additional stock return of 2% - .85% = 1.15%. This is the abnormal return for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segregation of certain decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental accounting effects also can help explain momentum in stock prices. The house money effect refers to gamblers&amp;rsquo; greater willingness to accept new bets if they currently are ahead. They think of (i.e., frame) the bet as being made with their &amp;ldquo;win- nings account,&amp;rdquo; that is, with the casino&amp;rsquo;s and not with their own money, and thus are more willing to accept risk. Analogously, after a stock market run-up, individuals may view investments as large ly funded out of a &amp;ldquo;capital gains account,&amp;rdquo; become more toler- ant of ris k, discount future cash flows at a lower rate, and thus further push up prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coupon / (1 + r)^t + Par value / (1 + r)^T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steady: compound periods, maturity date, coupon rate, face value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing: price and yield to maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and Face Value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When price is above face value, coupon rate &amp;gt; yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coupon rate and yield to maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yield &amp;gt; coupon rate, price is less than face value&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it weren&amp;rsquo;t? Then there would be easy profits to be made. For example, if
investment dealers ever noticed a bond selling for less than the amount at which the
sum of its parts could be sold, they would buy the bond, strip it into stand-alone zero-
coupon securities, sell off the stripped cash flows, and profit by the price difference . If the bond were selling for more than the sum of the values of its individual cash fl ows, they would run the process in reverse: buy the individual zero-coupon securities in the STRIPS market, &lt;strong&gt;reconstitute&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., reassemble) the cash flows into a coupon bond, and se ll the whole bond for more than the cost of the pieces. Bot h bond stripping and
bond reconstitution offer opportunities for arbitrage- the exploitation of mispricing
among two or more securities to clear a riskless economic profi t. Any violation of the
Law of One Price, that identical cash flow bundles must sell for identical prices, gives
rise to arbitrage opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;low interest rates means price is flat since risk of repurchase is high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With high interest rates, the price of the callable bond converges to that of a normal bond since the risk of call is negligible&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YTM assumes coupons are reinvested at the YTM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realized compound return is also a yield but is assumes that coupon payments are reinvested at the reinvestment rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forecasting the realized compound yield over various holding periods or investment horizons is &lt;strong&gt;horizon analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices of bonds with different coupon rates converge near maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPR: can only be forecasted
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-year bond selling at par value that pays an annual 10% coupon with a reinvestment rate of 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future Value = 1,000 + 100 + 100 * 1.08 = 1,208&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realized compound return: 1,000 * (1 + r)^2 = 1,208&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forward rate is just one year period, but spot rates can be multiple. {a = maturity period in years, b = years into the future}. y_{x} = yield for period x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can apply to mortgage interest rates as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates can be fixed at 1, 2, 3, etc. By forwarding rates, we can look at the best deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the 1 year rate need to be 4 years from now, to be indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquidity preference theory: forward rate is higher than expected rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve reflects expectations of future interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forecasts are clouded by liquidity premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upward sloping curve
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rates are expected to rise or liquidity premium to hold long term bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield predicts business cycle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term rates tend to rise in anticipation of economic expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inverted yield curve may indicate falling interest rates and signal a recession&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the discounted cash flow for each time a cashflow is received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the weights for each discounted cash flow as a percentage of the price (present value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply each weight by the period in time (e.g. cash flow in period 2 multiplied by 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macaulay&amp;rsquo;s duration is the sum of the time-weighted discounted cash flows in the previous step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weighted each time by the present value of cash flows at each time divided by the price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multiply each weight by the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duration equals the maturity for a zero coupon bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duration &amp;lt; maturity of a coupon bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;present value of a cash flow at a time divided by the price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modified duration is the duration discounted by the yield divided by the number of periods in a year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modified duration goes back a period because of better results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expected price % change = -D * (change in interest rate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assets with the same duration are equally sensitive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;divide duration by number of periods in a year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings management is the practice of using flexibility in accounting rules to improve the apparent profitability of the firm. We will have much to say on this topic in the next chapter on interpreting financial statements. A version of earnings management that became common in the 1990s was the reporting of &amp;ldquo;pro forma earnings&amp;rdquo; measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Asian
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on average stock price over a time period
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payoff is the difference between that average and the strike price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barrier
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depends on the price at expiration as well as if the price crossed a barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knock-out: if the price falls to a certain extent, the option expires worthless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knock-in: if the price does not fall to a certain extent, the option expires worthless&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lookback Options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depends on the minimum and maximum price of the underlying asset during the life time of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call option may provide payoff equal to maximum - strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put-call parity theorem is an equation representing the proper relation between put and call prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violation implies arbitrage opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell high side, buy low side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invest cash from sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C+\frac{X}{(1+r_f)^t}=S_0+P&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose C = 3, P = 3, X = 60, r = 5%, and stock price is 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell stock: + 60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell put: + 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy call -3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest -57.14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net: $2.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year or so, the investment becomes $60; You can either buy shares back at 60, your shares get called back at 60 because
of the put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; asset is CASH.TO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, 1 year expiry. OTM Call has premium (price) 30.48. Put has a premium of 43.50 with strike of 370.
Strike price is 370. risk-free rate is 4%. Stock price is 345.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30.48 + 370/1.04 = 345 + 43.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long straddle is established by buying both a call and a put on a stock, each with the same strike price and expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straddle is a bet on volatility. The cost of a straddle is the sum of the call and the put, P + C.
Final stock price must depart from X by this cost for the straddle to provide a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strips&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;straps&lt;/em&gt; are variations of the straddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to options however with futures and forward contract, there is an obligation to follow through with the agreed-upon transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward contracts call for future delivery at a currently agreed upon price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price holds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futures contract obliges traders to purchase or sell an asset at an agreed-upon &lt;strong&gt;futures price&lt;/strong&gt; at contract maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price may fluctuate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero-sum game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit is zero when spot price equals the initial futures price&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Speculators

&lt;li&gt;Hedgers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect against price movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long: protect against a higher spot price in the future&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violation of the parity relationship gives rise to arbitrage opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investor holds $1,000 in a mutual fund for S&amp;amp;P500/TSX Index
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividends of $20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The futures contract with delivery in one year trades for $1,010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since delivery doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the delivery of the dividends, the investor can hedge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect hedge should return the risk less rate of return&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>USDC De-pegging is/was Panic Selling</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 23:26:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/usdc-depegging-panic-selling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.circle.com/en/usdc&#34;&gt;USDC&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual currency that is supposed to be stabilized at a 1:1 ratio with the USD lost its peg due to a combination of two news events. Circle, the company that issues USDC and allows redemption of it for USD stated that it had 3.3B (8.175% of 40B) of its cash &amp;amp; cash equivalents in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_Bank&#34;&gt;Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)&lt;/a&gt;, the bank that collapsed last week. The second event was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1634399032767307776&#34;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; freezing redemptions with plans to recommence Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic selling immediately started and USDC lost its peg even more than 8.175%. All because investors were so pessimistic and worried that all 3.3B would be unrecoverable! I know this is coming after FDIC has made all depositors whole, but I will walk you through my thought process. Even if the 3.3B was unrecoverable, the peg would be 0.9125, not the 0.88 that was seen during the morning of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well when I woke up and I read the news, immediately started thinking of what the actual level of risk was. Well you see, the day before I was reading up on the SVB situation and my mind was figuring out the cause of the situation. The cause isn&amp;rsquo;t political like some charlestons may have you believe. Some people like to blame political jargon but not all issues are political, some is just incompetence! The incompetence being placing most of the depositors assets in a 10 year mortgage backed security with a 1.5% yield when interest rates were at their lowest. The cfo or investment manager at SVB did not anticipate interest rate increases once the inflation rates for 2022 stated coming in. Not only did they not factor in interest rate increases, they waited until multiple raises to realize that the unrealized losses and some realize losses that they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough cash to cover withdrawals! Anyways, the key detail is that the yield was 1.5%, maturity is 8 years now, and that the yield on comparable fixed income securities would be 3.7 to 4%. Fixed income market prices have an inverse proportion to yields, so if we use a bond price calculator to figure out relative prices, we see that in the worst case, SVB has a 730/880 = ~17.7% unrealized loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this information, in the worst case, circle would be out ~0.58B, not 3.3B out of the 40B or so assets they have. Some of these assets were in short term fixed income itself paying 0.4%. Thus the fair price in my mind wasn&amp;rsquo;t 91 cents but rather 99 cents and since redemption would starts back on Monday, this was a pure reward play which I would say is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but I&amp;rsquo;ll admit I sold my GME calls one day before they popped in 2021, so clearly these high reward low risk opportunities open up frequently. Since I had crypto on me, I could leverage kucoins 10x leverage and expect a 98% return in 2 days. Alas, my mind was more preoccupied with being right than making money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts on this analysis of mine, I&amp;rsquo;m open to criticism. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, the unrealized loss figures might be off, but the opportunity only lasted for 1 to 2 hours and I did not have the luxury to spend all that time finding all the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Blaming &#34;diversity&#34;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, WSJ included, like to point out that the bank failed because of diversity initiatives. This is very disingenuous.
First of all, management is 100% white in terms of race and not a single woman on management is in a position that is not stereotypically dominated by men. Second of all, diversity has nothing to do with intelligence! Diversity doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce critical thinking (unless it is done wrong) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t improve critical thinking unless cultural differences or differing experiences are taken advantage of. The only way diversity could have caused this bank failure is if there was a culture that promoted minimizing shareholder valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole situation is like that movie Margin Call, except the person working in risk is non-existent (Chief of Risk was vacant for 8 months while interest rates were being raised). Clearly, the people to blame for SVB&amp;rsquo;s collapse is management and then the board, although can the board really be blamed when it is management that was supposed to manage the company properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

      <title>How to Invest in the Stock Market as a Canadian</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 01:18:18 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My updated investing article. I wrote this with an emphasis on risk &amp;amp; safety rather than beating the market and gaining absurd returns. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the basics. By this point, you should realize that a stock is a type of share of a publicly traded company and a share at its most basic definition is some form of right to the company&amp;rsquo;s equity portion on their financial position. You could say a share is part ownership, but some stocks don&amp;rsquo;t have voter rights, and even if some do, there&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a controlling shareholder. Thus, from the perspective of most individuals, shares are simply rights to the equity of a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-brokerage&#34; &gt;What is a Brokerage?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-a-brokerage&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start investing, you will need to open an account it through a platform called a brokerage. A brokerage allows you to trade shares of companies, baskets of stocks (aka ETFs and exchange traded funds), and derivatives of stocks (aka options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-open-an-account-canada&#34; &gt;Where to Open an Account (Canada)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#where-to-open-an-account-canada&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend opening a QuesTrade account now that they have $0 commissions. When you open an account, you will be asked what type of account(s) you wish to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-accounts&#34; &gt;Types of Accounts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-accounts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you open an account, it&amp;rsquo;s best to learn about the different types of accounts that are available in your country of residence. Accounts that are defined by the government are called &lt;em&gt;registered&lt;/em&gt; accounts and normal brokerage accounts are called &lt;em&gt;unregistered accounts&lt;/em&gt; and are ubiquitous across countries. For example, Canadians have access to these registered accounts. The maximum amount you can contribute to these accounts is listed under your account information with the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;registered-accounts&#34; &gt;Registered Accounts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#registered-accounts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room for this account will increase by thousands of dollars every year you are a resident of Canada regardless of income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room is cumulative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room will increase a year after withdrawals (not quite a year actually, but not within the same tax year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room available on CRA website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax deductible contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawals are taxed and do not increase the contribution room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room is cumulative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room increases based on salary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html&#34;&gt;Home Buyers&amp;rsquo; Plan&lt;/a&gt; lets you withdraw up to a certain amount with the condition that you repay it. I suggest reading the link above for when you do plan on making a withdrawal as the rules are ever-changing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room available on CRA website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Home Savings Account (FHSA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to open an account when you turn 18 even if you don&amp;rsquo;t plan on contributing to it until your 22 or something, so that you can benefit from the 1 year accumulation and contribute double when you save a lot in one working year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax-deductible contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifetime contribution limit of $40,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearly contribution of $8,000 which accumulates for only a single year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t contribute to the FHSA for 3 years. year 1: $8,000 contribution room, year 2: $16,000 contribution room, year 3: $16,000 contribution room, year 4: $8,000 (deposited $8,000), year 5: $0 (deposited $16,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/first-home-savings-account/contributing-your-fhsa.html&#34;&gt;FHSA eligibility and more information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One plan per child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/estimating-amounts.html&#34;&gt;Information about the RESP as well as grant eligibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a way to optimize this plan, but I forget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;optimal-registered-account-contributions&#34; &gt;Optimal Registered Account Contributions

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max out FHSA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While FHSA is still available, contribute max of $12,000 per year to RRSP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you already own a house, contribute the amount you think you won&amp;rsquo;t need until you plan to retire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to marginal tax rates, your withdrawals could be taxed lower than your current income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max out TFSA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-registered-accounts&#34; &gt;Non-Registered Accounts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#non-registered-accounts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin: ability to buy shares with borrowed funds or borrow shares to sell
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use margin to borrow, then it can get very dangerous because you will be trading with &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example of leverage: Suppose I borrow $99,000 and I only have $1,000 and I buy a stock which goes down by 1%. I lose $1,000 of my own money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of account is useful to apply some non-leveraged options strategies which I mention at the bottom of the article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the risk of options trading, you may be restricted from using them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I recommend investing at least two years&lt;/strong&gt; before trying to use options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-invest&#34; &gt;How to Invest
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-invest&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing is something everyone can do. Trading is a different ball game and requires sophisticated strategies and perspectives on the market. Both are used to grow capital, however investing is inherently less risky than trading. Investing capital growth relies on the weighted average performance of the shares you own, whereas trading may rely on a few concentrated shares. We&amp;rsquo;ll first go over two ways to invest, and one way to trade. For each strategy, I recommend investing 11% Canadian and 89% U.S. just for optimal diversification (population ratios). The easiest way for a company to increase its profits is via population growth, which is why I recommend this ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With IBKR, I suggest just using the platform as the fees are very affordable. With other brokerages however, I suggest employing Norbert&amp;rsquo;s Gambit to avoid percentage foreign exchange fees. This is incredibly simple for RBC. Buy DLR and sell (short) DLR.U. RBC will settle both balances automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIth a brokerage like Questrade, I usually value invest, so I buy a bank stock traded on the TSX and NYSE and then ask the brokerage support to journal the shares that I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on holding. So I might buy 300 shares of TSX:BNS, and then journal 270 of them to NYSE and then sell them. Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, the stock has appreciated while holding it for a few days, and technically speaking if stocks are priced to return capital, stocks should be going up most of the time anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passive-etf-investing&#34; &gt;Passive ETF Investing
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#passive-etf-investing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way to invest, is passive. Passive investment can be done by purchasing ETFs, which are baskets of shares in companies that particular ETF says they hold in. For passive investment, funds that encapsulate 100+ stocks based on market-cap or location are recommended. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview&#34;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; index is the defacto market index whenever people mention or talk about the stock market in the context of North America. It is so influential that the concept of risk-adjusted returns (Beta) of individual stocks and ETFs is compared to the market (S&amp;amp;P 500) return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long-term passive investing, I recommend the following portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International ex-USA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (35%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VSUX (30%)
Index ETF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA (25% of the global economy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$AVUV (15%): US small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$EQL.TO / $RSP (10%): US equal-weighted SP500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discretionary (10%)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either stock picking or one of the ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to use Norbert&amp;rsquo;s gambit to avoid FX-fees when buying DISV, VXUS, and AVUV. If that&amp;rsquo;s too complicated, just buy VEQT.TO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.invesco.com/ca-en/exchange-traded-funds/invesco-s-p-500-equal-weight-index-etf---cad&#34;&gt;TSX:EQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.invesco.com/us-rest/contentdetail?contentId=e3fc7c23dbd92610VgnVCM1000006e36b50aRCRD&amp;amp;dnsName=us&#34;&gt;RSP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf&#34;&gt;DISV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of these index ETFs are market-cap weighted, a lot of them can easily be concentrated among big tech which are companies that typically outperform during bull runs and outperform during bear runs. Typically a bull-ruin lasts longer than a bear, so the advice is to invest in these concentrated &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; ETFs during a bear run and keep investing in them until the bull run has surpassed the previous highs by an annualized 10% return. At that point, it may be more prudent to switch to investing in equal-weighed ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passive-value-investing&#34; &gt;Passive Value Investing
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#passive-value-investing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value investing is where you have the capability to value a stock. Valuing a stock is incredibly difficult, as it has been proven that most hedge funds and mutual funds cannot outperform the returns given by investing in the market. Still, with value investing, you need to rely on diversification. From studies, the risk of your portfolio can be reduced to systemic but the marginal improvement diminishes at around the 20 stock market. What does that mean? Invest in chunks of 1/20. So if you can only find 6 stocks that are under-valued, you invest 14/20 of your cash in a market ETF, and only 1/20 in each of the stocks you picked. This way, your portfolio&amp;rsquo;s performance isn&amp;rsquo;t impacted drastically by the business risk of a few handful of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real example of business risk that I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered is NEP, which has been renamed itself and its ticker to XIFR. This company turned out to be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/how-to-spot-a-dividend-value-trap/&#34;&gt;value trap&lt;/a&gt;. I was betting partially on interest rates to be cut, and that the dividend (payout ratio &amp;gt; 1) would sustain any continued hemorrhaging. However, what I did not expect was for the company to rename itself to distance itself from its close-arm partner Nextera Energy, and announce that the dividend would be suspended and redirected to paying off the debt. I should start a RED FLAGS list because I could&amp;rsquo;ve saved myself money if I treated any smell as a red flag. With this company, I bought into it multiple times and didn&amp;rsquo;t sell the excess weight when I did recoup my losses. Anyways, what was the end result after a year of investing? I had a profit of ~30%, and after the loss my profit is 21%. This makes sense if the Beta of the portfolio is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Thesis idea&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research the average percent of companies that had negative returns under 0% to under 20%. Also make sure to account for stocks that are acquired and delisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is META in 2022. It actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the business is doing well, the market can perceive the company to be doing poorly. By diversifying, your portfolio will continue to perform at the market, and can outperform the market after you re-balance it. A re-balance would be selling some shares in stocks that you don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to outperform anymore, and topping up losers as if you just invested 1/20 of your portfolio. Sometimes, you may want to double your position. Doubling your position is very risky because you don&amp;rsquo;t to risk timing the stock&amp;rsquo;s bottom. I highly suggest doing it whenever the stock drops 10%+. When a stock that you deem is under-valued (and isn&amp;rsquo;t a fairly valued growth stock) drops by this much, you can view it as a discount. Capital markets theory even dictates that prices adjust down to improve the expected return. So if a stock goes down by 5%, the stock&amp;rsquo;s value goes down &amp;hellip; because it&amp;rsquo;s expected to return a set percentage. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain this, but think about wanting a 10% return and the company is doing well. You find out today some information that makes you think the stock is worth less. You still want 10%, but you know the value of the company must be lower to achieve that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active investing is outlining a strategy, such as growth/momentum and having a very short-term horizon where you could be buying and selling a stock the next week. Day trading is not active investing, as day trading is never about trading based on opportunity, and the losses of day traders make that clear. Never day trade, never look at stock that are momentum, because there&amp;rsquo;s a high chance you did not purchase the stock at the day&amp;rsquo;s lowest. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to predict the future, yet day trading only works if you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-orders&#34; &gt;Types of Orders

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit order: a bid to buy a stock at a max price OR an ask to sell your stock at min price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limit order can either be non-marketable or marketable. When you place a limit order that is marketable, that means you will acquire/sell your shares but have set a price that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to exceed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market order: buying whatever the sellers are offering and vice versa. Use with discretion when the spread for buy and sell is small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;option-contracts&#34; &gt;Option Contracts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#option-contracts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchasing option contracts (option henceforth) can easily become gambling since it&amp;rsquo;s hard to gauge how much money to use to purchase an option. At the basics, an options contract provide the holder an option to do something with the underlying share it is linked to. For example, options that gives the holder the right (not obligation) to buy shares at a specific price (the strike price), is call a Call and an option that gives the holder the right to sell shares at a specific price is called a Put. Options have expiry dates, so holding onto an option with an unfavourable strike price would mean that if the underlying stock does not move to a favourable price, your option may expire worthless! Similar to a margin account, options are a leveraged strategy. However,  &lt;strong&gt;Your loss is limited to your cash purchase.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s very useful for short-term speculations, where you are 99% sure of some sort of event, but of course, speculation backed by hunch is gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options can also be used in lieu of owning shares for a slight bump in leverage. The hardest part of purchasing options will be valuing them. There are all sorts of models, both academic (Black-Scholes-Merton) and proprietary. Options can be at the money (strike price very close to or equal to the market price of the stock), in the money (favourable to execute the option. The strike price is less than the market price for calls and the strike price is higher than the market price for puts), or out of the money (the price is purely based on the models or speculation, and are not executable as the strike price is not in the money). Lastly, options are usually priced at a per share basis but represent 100 shares at a time. So if I a call option for IBM is trading at $1/share and I purchase one options contract, I pay 100x. This is somewhat where the leverage comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to allocate some money to a stock you can&amp;rsquo;t even afford 1 share of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What not to do: purchase a call option with a strike price close to the market price of the stock with an expiration date nearby. This is speculative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you could try to do: Purchase a call option that is (a) dated far out (b) is as deep in the money as you can afford
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every couple of months, you may want to &lt;em&gt;roll&lt;/em&gt; the contract. A roll is when you sell your contract and buy a further dated contract in one order and pay/receive the difference in market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend employing this strategy if you can afford many shares of the company, because shares can move double digit percentages without you being able to foretell. Even if you roll the contracts, option contracts are usually not free to trade on Canadian brokerages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you hold a call option with a strike price of $10. The option is in the money and you want to take your profit. You can either sell the option at the market price which is most preferable or you can exercise the option. Exercising the option doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you get shares for free, it means that you will pay $10/share for 100 shares (1 contract). This is important to understand if you want to take part as the options writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose (in a margin account) you own shares in a company that you don&amp;rsquo;t think will move significantly within your time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write (sell) a Covered-Call: If you own multiples of 100 shares, you can sell out the money call options such that if the share price is above the strike price, you will only miss out on the gains, but will not be losing money, unlike a Naked Call, where you are on the hook for the price difference. You get paid for giving away your right to have your shares taken away from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to own shares in a company that you don&amp;rsquo;t think will move up significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write (sell) a Cash-Covered Put: If you are have $6,000 and are willing to hold that much of a company, then you can write a put option at strike prices less or equal than &lt;code&gt;6000 / 100^n&lt;/code&gt; and you get a deposit for selling someone the right to sell their shares to you. You must ensure that you are writing only as many put options as you can cover using cash. For example, 1 put option at a strike price of $60 takes up $6000 of your entire buying power, even if you do have more than $6000/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures are similar to options but most sides have an obligation to deliver or take delivery of the underlying assets. The underlying asset could be equities or even goods. Sometimes the delivery is cash-settled due to how these contracts are used by investors. If a contract is cash-settled, it&amp;rsquo;s usually used for hedging rather than for budgeting purposes. Equity futures are most important for traders predicting the direction of the market (see E-Mini futures) or for institutions who want to hedge their portfolio and change its risk without having to buy many different options. For more information, I recommend reading my notes for &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-423&#34;&gt;Options, Futures, Swaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoiding-yield-traps&#34; &gt;Avoiding Yield Traps
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#avoiding-yield-traps&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest red flag is when the dividend yield is higher than the EPS. In these scenarios, the dividend is funded by cashflows and not income, and at a certain point in the future, when that cashflow is required as capital investment, the dividend cannot be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason why cashflow is higher than net income, and that reason is usually depreciation which indicates that in the future, a capital investment (cashflow only transaction) will be made. Thus, it is imperative to judge a companies dividend based on their net income and not their cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One situation where it&amp;rsquo;s not a red flag is if the company has had dividend increases for 50+ years. If the company has not been around for that long, just assume it&amp;rsquo;s a yield trap. Technically, you could get away with using a % of the yield to buy puts that are equal to a drop of the yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second situation where it&amp;rsquo;s not a red flag is if a company had a spinoff, because the dividend is expected to be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
