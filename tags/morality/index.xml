      <title>RANT: This World Is a Joke</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is without a doubt that human beings en-masse aren&amp;rsquo;t actually capable of critical thinking. There are many cultures in the world, and many countries with differing levels of economic power, and standards of living. There are countries that have been a democracy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; longer than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cultures practice certain beliefs. When discussing morality, I find it often that people&amp;rsquo;s morality is defined by the society they come from and not the values they have proved and developed themselves. This sort of thinking is very â€” simple minded and shows a lack of self-reflection and nuance that we humans believe we have. Humans pride themselves on the belief that they are intelligent but when met with a culture that has normalized something they find immoral, their first instinct is to - condemn, Condemn, CONDEMN - the other culture, rather than looking within to correct instances of self wrong-doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific problem I am talking about is Male Genital Mutilation, also known as foreskin removal or male baby circumcision. This practice is  tolerated by every country in the world. Iceland stopped short of a full ban, by allowing a religious exemption, but that is part of the problem. If we can tolerate male circumcision because of religious tolerance, then why can we not tolerate female genital mutation that is part of a culture in a country in Africa? When googling&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;Why is FGM wrong,&amp;rdquo; the first argument is that FGM interferes with the &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; function of women&amp;rsquo;s bodies. This is the worst argument as lust, envy, greed, vengeance (some say wrath, but I disagree with wrath&amp;rsquo;s definition), gluttony (obesity), and sloth are all &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; occurring in humans but we know that they are wrong (long-term self-harm without dopamine is wrong which is the argument I would use to argue that gluttony and obesity are also wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite preposterous for the WHO to advocate against FGM since 2008, but 16 years later, inform people nothing of Involuntary male circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FGM and MGM are wrong because there is no relief in health issues and neither does the baby consent to it. These are very strong reasons and the only ones we need to argue against FGM and MGM. Many proponents of MGM come from a religious background and use the following argument. &amp;ldquo;It reduces risk of STI.&amp;rdquo; This is a very poor argument because abstaining from sex also reduces STI. Should we regulate when people can have sex (rhetorical question although sex between adults is already regulated)? Or maybe we should remove their penises entirely, because if they are incapable of having sex, then they can&amp;rsquo;t get STIs. But now you will say that penis is for reproduction. To that I will say that some men have no possibility of reproduction nor are they free of hereditary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the penis&amp;rsquo; existence is to engage in sex for pleasure, and reproduction is a side effect of said activity. Therefore, the act of removing foreskin, and thus reducing pleasure, is synonymous with the act of removing the flesh of the penis head as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take it a step further. In Quebec, a person had their fingers removed due to psychological issues. Should we all follow suit because we can all develop the same psychological issues? No. Maybe Ubisoft knew something before all of us when they came up with that finger chopping lore in their Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Aside on Abortion rights&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to morality being the subject matter, I want to also provide a snippet of the rationale I use to support Abortion rights without having to think about when life starts and other irrelevant contextual information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for abortion is very simple. No country has property rights that prevent the owner from kicking someone out. A parent can kick their child out whenever they want. There is no legal contractual obligation to even keep the child once the child is born. Therefore, if a fetus is deemed to be trespassing (i.e. unwanted), it does not really matter if the eviction (abortion) results in its death. If the fetus could be preserved, I would be an advocate for it, just as I am an advocate that resuscitation of a fetus should not be the parents&amp;rsquo; right. An abortion is a clear separation of legal duties, and what happens to the fetus outside of a womb, is the concern of society and the state, but not the mother. This is similar to how an eviction of a trespasser of physical land would work. It&amp;rsquo;s society&amp;rsquo;s problem and dealing to the issue, not the property owner. The property owner doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide what to do with the trespasser (except in cases of self-defence), society (police) does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A democracy is defined as people being able to become citizens by at the very least being the child of a citizen, and all citizens except for ones serving a sentence have the right and accessibility to vote and there is no law that can discriminate a sub-class of citizens. For example, before civil rights, was the USA really a democracy if segregation was enforced by states themselves? Absolutely not.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling: Using the Google search engine to search for web pages on the internet. I tried to get away from Google in the past by using DuckDuckGo, but eventually came back to using Google.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Mark Zuckerberg and the Metaverse Are Moral Failures</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/mark-zuckerburg-and-the-metaverse-are-moral-failures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine being the CEO of a corporation with billions of dollars of which you are also the majority shareholder. Not only do you control billions of dollars personally but you control a corporation with billions of dollars in cash in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your company makes money based on the amount of time people spend on your products because the more time spent on the platforms you provide results in more time spent looking at the ads that pay your platforms to be shown to your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you decide that users shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be able to spend some of their time on these apps but should be able to &amp;rsquo;live&amp;rsquo; within a virtual world with virtual products at their finger tips. Instead of physically doing activities you believe it is more ideal to virtually do them in one spot with worse graphics than video games and without any physical sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You admit and know that this venture will cost the company billions of dollars over the next 5 years and decide that this is the best use of money for not just the corporation but humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a colossal moral failure. There are people going hungry every day even though there is more than enough food being produced (citation required). There are countless cases of STI&amp;rsquo;s spread in Africa and yet more than enough money to provide sexual education. The local food supply of these countries cannot keep up with the local population growth. Instead of investing in humanity, META, lead by Mark Zuckerberg is insistent on investing and subsidizing the Metaverse; virtual reality headsets, programs and fictional places hosted by servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building the next wonder of the world or producing real wealth, mark Zuckerberg has decided to waste and dump wealth and direct it towards projects that don&amp;rsquo;t even relate or help the average person in this world. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to admit to spending billions of dollars into a loss maker, at least think to yourself if that&amp;rsquo;s the best use of money for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely disappointing that we have a history reminding us of the moral failures of the past and we choose to falsely believe that the present is morally righteous without faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lie and the humans of the future - if any exist - will look at the peak of the world economy and take note at how the most powerful people in this world failed to help the very humans who gave them power and how morality becomes optional as one acquires more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was never moral to begin with if the acquisition of power leads to immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to write this after coming across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.the-sun.com/tech/8261218/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-meta-quest-3-metaverse-dead/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Zuckerberg unveils new Metaverse product despite claims VR world is â€˜deadâ€™ with one platform only having 38 users&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/metaverse-dead-obituary-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-fad-ai-chatgpt-2023-5&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;RIP Metaverse - An obituary for the latest fad to join the tech graveyard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
