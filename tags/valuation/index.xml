      <title>Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is not a long-term BUY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025-06: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a position in LULU, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also placed a limit sell order at ~$385.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally came to this conclusion in September (12th), but it was sitting in my pinned Google Keep for months. The recent sky rocketing of LULU is just another piece of evidence that the market is irrational. The stock was bleeding for months when I decided it might be time to buy but my investing philosophy at the time was &amp;ldquo;is it possible to regret my purchase in 10 years.&amp;rdquo; When I invest in stocks, I value peace of mind over maximizing profits. Of course, one way to do that is to invest for a specific time horizon. The other way, which I am going to start implementing is to do the work to arrive at a sell price. That was the strategy to use when it comes to LULU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compelling reason that existed to buy LULU is because I thought the Chinese will buy their apparel when their economy recovers (I was proven right as the stock skyrocketed recently on International sales). Even so, I still needed a sell price. And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to arrive at the short-term fair price, so heuristics will need to be used (for future stock considerations). Two heuristics I employ are industry P/E (many issues with P/E) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.koyfin.com/share/e31aae25cd&#34;&gt;historic cashflow yield standard deviations&lt;/a&gt; as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/stocks/koyfin_lulu_20241208_040544132.webp&#34; alt=&#34;LULU Cash Flow Yield&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase LULU in September is because &lt;strong&gt;this is not a buy and hold stock&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you go on Instagram, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly realize that LULU does not actually have a moat and many relatively unknown and yet sizable brands, are also using influencer marketing such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/keepthatpump/&#34;&gt;KeepThatPump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dfyne.official/&#34;&gt;dfyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/whitefoxboutique/&#34;&gt;White Fox Boutique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates market saturation and is a red flag to me. This is also why I never bought and do not recommended stocks like Celsius. The good thing about all this research though is that I have a list of luxe-like retailers for the purpose of buying gifts. These companies could make a lot of money if they also started targeting ads at men in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So investing in retail stocks would usually require very high insight into the market so that you can quickly respond to trends. Sorry, that&amp;rsquo;s not me, but the investment funds that manage billions of dollars in assets could easily pay someone to keep track of these trends for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailer stocks include but are not limited to LULU, ANF, CROX, BBW. The problem I have with these stocks isn&amp;rsquo;t their valuation. They could be undervalued, I&amp;rsquo;m just saying that these stocks are better valued by actual professional analysts who have more market trend information on their hand than individual investors who can only really buy using &lt;strong&gt;anecdotal, financial, and/or macro analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Micro-economics is an advantage for being an investment banking analyst, but when it&amp;rsquo;s not a full time job, you need to be aware of [your] bounded rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why DigitalOcean (DOCN) is not a Buy</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 18:35:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it time for me to sell &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOCN/&#34;&gt;$DOCN&lt;/a&gt;? A perspective from a fan and hopefully soon to be ex-shareholder. This is not a bearish take, just a value-portfolio analysis perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34; &gt;Summary
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like DOCN as a company, however I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it&amp;rsquo;s own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34; &gt;What I Used to Think about DOCN
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of ~20 &amp;ldquo;undervalued&amp;rdquo; stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I&amp;rsquo;m up 11% which is better than my benchmark &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MORT/&#34;&gt;$MORT&lt;/a&gt; which has returned 7% during this time. MORT is my benchmark because I was expecting interest rates to be cut and so I expected this ETF to appreciate in value once that happened while paying out* higher than the overnight federal funds rate / risk-free in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-competitive-analysis&#34; &gt;Business-Competitive Analysis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#business-competitive-analysis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they&amp;rsquo;ve done incorrectly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how nice their products are, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how cost effective they are&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don&amp;rsquo;t even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.serverhunter.com&#34;&gt;serverhunter.com&lt;/a&gt;) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. live streaming which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use &amp;ldquo;competitive advantage&amp;rdquo; as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: apparently DigitalOcean VPS&amp;rsquo;s are trash when it comes to performance compared to OvhCloud and Vultr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;financial-merit-compared-to-my-alternative-holds-and-buys&#34; &gt;Financial Merit Compared to My Alternative Holds and Buys
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#financial-merit-compared-to-my-alternative-holds-and-buys&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;P/E is over 60, Beta over 1.5, QoQ growth has been 2-4% last 3 quarters. FCF market cap yield is 3% compared to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% at Google (which is a mature &amp;amp; profitable company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit that I pay a dollar extra per month on Heroku plus the certificate cost just because I used to host my website on Heroku which dropped the free tier after salesforce acquired the.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lithium Americas Valuation (LAC)</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lithium-americas-valuation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2024 21:39:42 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lithium-americas-valuation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is a mining corporation focused on extracting sedimentary lithium from &lt;a href=&#34;https://lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/overview/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Thacker Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;The largest known &lt;strong&gt;Measured&lt;/strong&gt; and Indicated Resource in North America.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lithiumamericas.com/investor/overview/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;TSX:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nyse.com/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;NYSE:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: $ is in the USD denomination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Lithium Americas announced a share issuance of 55,000,000 shares for a total of 250,000,000 ($5/share). The first part values the company using efficient market hypothesis. The second part is a quasi-dividend discount model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Efficient Market Hypothesis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#valuing-based-on-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair price of $4.97. Upside of 30 cents of 8% on top of required rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Before Announcement = $6.66
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding before = 162.16M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Market Cap Before = $6.66 * 162.16 = 1,080M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares added = 55M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding present = 217.16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Ceteris Paribus = $4.97
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upside 0.37 cents per share or 8% based on recent after close pricing.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary: This is more of a question on whether the market will figure out that LAC is trading at a discount. I remember when PBR dropped 11%+ and it came back up for the dividend. I sold it before the CEO was replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Future Dividend Distributions
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is fairly valued at [4.43, 4.9] using conservative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough valuation was done using conservative assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;192.9 Mega ton of proven reserves equivalent to 3.3 mega tons of Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price per ton: US $5,400
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the Thacker Pass is operational, selling at a price higher than this lower bound will draw returns over 10% on the investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful life: 40 years
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although production will be smaller in the earlier years and double in the later years, we will assume a smoothened annuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mining net profit margin = 7%
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net profit margins vary between the years and can be as high as 20% or as low as -7%. Better to pick a number that makes sense in the long-term. 7% could be an over-estimate, but if mining corporations were known to have low net profit margins, the market would be valuing it a significantly less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount rate of 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Annuity = 3.3 * 1000000 * 5400 * 0.07 / 40 = $31,185,000 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the annuity formula, we get a present value of 304,959,697. The PV is a year before the plant becomes operational. We will assume 2025, but the longer it takes, the longer we will under-perform the  market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add back Net Tangible Assets of 407,462,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus the Cash infusion of $250,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair Value = 712,421,697 + 250,000,000
= 962,421,697&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided by shares outstanding of 217.16M and we get US $4.43, which is only 4% less than the last price of $4.60 and 6% less than the last closing price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fair value price at the end of the year is higher than the current price, the current price is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EMH, LAC is a buy. After a valuation, the risk is if Phase 1 will be passed, which is likely given the $250,000,000 cash infusion. Since the stock is valued fairly using safe assumptions, LAC is a buy for risk-seekers. For the risk-averse, fair-value without profits can never be a buy.&lt;/p&gt;
