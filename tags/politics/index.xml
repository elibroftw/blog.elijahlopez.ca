      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canada doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a productivity crisis. It has a lack of JOBS. And the lack of JOBS comes from the lack of COMPETITION which comes from a lack of LEADERSHIP. All our country&amp;rsquo;s problems are ARTIFICIAL (MAN MADE). We can&amp;rsquo;t even build a fucking road in this country!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rent-is-too-damn-high&#34; &gt;Rent is Too Damn High
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rent-is-too-damn-high&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we address home ownership, we must first dissect this statement. A lot of people who will never own a home are under the impression that rent itself is too high and that owning would be comparable or cheaper rather than more expensive. I agree with them that renting is too expensive but disagree that they think improving ownership is not important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix the rental market we must first understand what allows rent to be so high in the first place. Sure, land lords choose to charge rent at a high level, but the how isn&amp;rsquo;t because of a lack of government intervention, and that&amp;rsquo;s because we don&amp;rsquo;t just have high rent, we have a &lt;strong&gt;shortage of housing units&lt;/strong&gt;. If the government simply added a price cap per square footage, then all it does is make hoarding rental units more lucrative than building new units!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to address high rent, we need more housing units to be built. Why is housing shortage an artificial problem? Well let&amp;rsquo;s focus just on Toronto, as Ontario has a greenbelt and zoning limited to triplexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem regarding housing shortage is that housing starts have plummeted. A few levers that are in the government&amp;rsquo;s control are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing foreign buyers to buy pre-construction condos. They were banned a few years ago as they were scapegoated. Clearly, they had nothing to do with the housing crisis and interestingly were helping out with ensuring new housing got built by taking the risk on behalf of domestic investors. Without foreign buyers, developers are having a harder time selling pre-construction condos at prices they are still profitable. It is simply absurd to expect a developer to sell pre-construction condos at market prices that would result in them losing money. They are not forced to build, and increasing property taxes on the land itself wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ensure housing gets built, but ensures developers realize a loss on the land itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower taxes, even temporarily, so that pre-construction costs can fall lower than market clearing prices. Taxes are slowing down the growth of housing supply. This is a fact.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One such tax is the GST and HST applicable to even buyers who want to upgrade from their existing home. The more costly and thus difficult it is for existing home owners to upgrade, the slower the housing supply grows, and the less affordable options remain for first time home buyers. It is very improbable that a new house in an equal location without GST will be cheaper to buy for a first time home buyer than an existing 20+ year old house. The GST being removed for first time home buyers would push prices of existing homes down if only the new homes were even within the same price range to begin with!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower developer charges. The city of Toronto&amp;rsquo;s development reserve fund has ballooned for the last 10 years. The federal government must mandate that any funding for the city will come only after the developer reserve fund has been used such that it sits at the per-100k values before 2017 (adjusted for inflation). If the city is forced to use their development reserve fund, they may willingly lower developer charges. If they don&amp;rsquo;t and they stick to the growth pays for growth, then the federal government will save money and be able to &lt;em&gt;redirect money into housing initiatives in cities that have the lowest developer charges like Edmonton&lt;/em&gt;. My thoughts are that the government should step in once the free market has actually failed rather than stepping in while the free market has significant blockades!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repeat-offenders&#34; &gt;Repeat Offenders
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#repeat-offenders&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very fact that repeat offenders exist, where they commit violent crimes more than once within a few years, is evidence that the justice system itself is failing. This isn&amp;rsquo;t some natural world sort of ordeal. This is entirely in the government&amp;rsquo;s hands to prevent violent criminals from re-entering society without any sort of rehabilitation whatsoever. If criminals don&amp;rsquo;t receive rehabilitation, then they should be kept in prison. And if prison is too cruel, then improve the conditions of the prison so that they can live a life without endangering law-abiding residents. A prison town is a fine solution if the courts seriously think 5 years is too much for sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;healthcare&#34; &gt;Healthcare
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#healthcare&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems in healthcare is multifold, but stems from a lack of investment and long-term planning from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely artificial. The doctor shortage comes from a residency shortage which comes from a lack of investment in building hospitals. We are behind the USA when it comes to MRIs per 100,000 population. A country with free healthcare should strive to make healthcare more accessible than a country with private healthcare, rather than accept it is less accessible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By building more hospitals, yes the demand for doctors grows, however, there will be more space to train new doctors which is where one of the bottlenecks are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second bottleneck is education. We need new universities catered to the medical/healthcare field. We need a &lt;em&gt;University of Ontario Institute of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; similar to how we have a &lt;em&gt;University of Ontario Institute of Technology&lt;/em&gt;. The later was created from Bill 109, so yes doctor shortage is an artificial one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply absurd that smart Canadians who want to become doctors have to go study outside the country and even then can&amp;rsquo;t do their residency here. Not to mention, the wages are completely obscure. What I mean by that is that when you search up physician wages in Ontario, you can&amp;rsquo;t tell if its the revenue that a self-operated clinic will get or the earnings before tax. A physician operating their own clinic will get revenues from the government via OHIP but has to pay for all this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;office rent / mortgage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secretary (software might be able to automate this, but not really since there are too many seniors who are not tech savvy enough to deal with the lack of a person at the front desk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supplies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;book keeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they pay themselves a salary. This is too much business stuff for someone who wants to practice medicine! My personal take is that we allow non-physicians to create and manage clinics so that they are the ones competing with hospitals to hire physicians rather than putting the onus only on physicians to start one up or scale it. Maybe this is already the case, but this is not my major point anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tariffs&#34; &gt;Tariffs
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tariffs&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is a blessing in disguise for two reasons. First the government can blame Trump for Canada&amp;rsquo;s problems, even those that existed before. Secondly, it gives Canada a strong reason to address non-US trade issues. In my blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/trade-wars-and-trade-balances&#34;&gt;On Trade Wars and Trade Balances&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about how tariffs can be used to &amp;ldquo;tax the rich&amp;rdquo; and incentivize domestic companies to capture surplus profits (and thus become competitive with foreign markets). I also mentioned that taxes can be used to capture extrinsic value of foreign goods where consumers are not importing for any intrinsic value the goods may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inter-provincial-trade-barriers&#34; &gt;Inter-Provincial Trade Barriers
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#inter-provincial-trade-barriers&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not beat around the bush. Without Trump&amp;rsquo;s insane tariffs, the Liberal party would not have even thought about eliminating inter-provincial trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be attending a talk on this on September 25th, I will update this article after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jobs&#34; &gt;Jobs
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#jobs&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how most people measure success. Success is that you have a well paying job and can enjoy life based on your salary. Salary comes from a demand for labour at a price point that labour will be supplied. By jobs, I mean jobs all over the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two &amp;ldquo;fixes&amp;rdquo; regarding the jobs problem. We effectively want to lower the unemployment rate so that it equals the historic natural rate of unemployment. If we are above the historic natural rate of unemployment, we need to either create more jobs or decrease the competition for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Keynesian infrastructure spending policies&lt;/del&gt;: applicable only during economic contractions, not expansions. If the government is borrowing during an economic expansion, something is seriously wrong with how the country is managed and the consequences are not known and will be felt in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce immigration. I made the argument 4 months ago in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaHousing2/comments/1kxxsrc/the_immigration_cuts_would_need_to_double_to/&#34;&gt;May 2025&lt;/a&gt; that immigration should be reduced from 395,000 to 240,000. This is based on the fact that the job shortage went from increasing at 20k/mo in 2024 to 10k/mo in 2025 after a cut from 485,000 to 395,000. So if we extrapolate, we get to the 240,000 figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking winners correctly; Investment in high profit margin businesses. The government must stop picking winners and losers and rather follow where the winners already are. We have basically missed the boat regarding GPUs. China has already started creating their own GPUs. GPUs during the AI rush are like the shovels during the gold rush! Instead of investing in the core technology that makes AI profitable, the government is helping our companies pay for importing expensive GPUs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop. picking. losers. The government is picking losers when it defends bills like C-69 (impact assessment act) and the emissions cap. This also follows through the recently passed Bill C-5, which lets the government decide which projects are worthy of cutting down the impact assessment act. Theoretically, if Canada was 10x the population with 10x more proposed projects, the government would be spending 10x more effort at achieving the same economic growth. That&amp;rsquo;s how futile this sort of &amp;ldquo;office&amp;rdquo; is. But the worse part is that it ensures the sandbagging of economic growth by favouring some projects over the others. The best example of how the government is doing a bad job at picking losers is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.martenfallsaccessroad.ca/&#34;&gt;Marten Falls Access Road&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.supplyroad.ca/&#34;&gt;Webequie Supply Road&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://northernroadlink.ca/&#34;&gt;Northern Road Link&lt;/a&gt;. These are all INDIGENOUS LED PROJECTS. Also, another thing that destroys down economic activity are small taxes like the luxury tax which reduced our ship building industry&amp;rsquo;s economic output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cost-of-living-crisis&#34; &gt;Cost of Living Crisis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cost-of-living-crisis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from rent, there are a lot of goods with high price tags. These prices are high because there is someone, out there, willing to purchase these goods at these high prices. The solution is to shine a light on substitutes and competitors as well as promoting competition in every industry even those where mergers would not result in prices going up. More competition isn&amp;rsquo;t just a way to ensure prices are affordable (by diminishing excess profit margins over time), but also ensures that there are multiple companies competing for the same talent pool, ensuring that real wages won&amp;rsquo;t fall like they would in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp&#34;&gt;monopsony&lt;/a&gt; labour market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were looking to get our windows replaced and guess what we were quoted for the best in the industry? $83,000 cash. $93,000 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a book shelf. This is not a new invention. This is not a unique design. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon, non-standard designs: &amp;lt; $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ikea, ideal design: $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ikea, ideal design with two bottom drawers: $129&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structube, cabinet design: $239&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structube, no backboard design: $200+ (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.structube.com/en_ca/reno-acacia-wood-5tier-bookcase-96-65-69?pid=27406&#34;&gt;one is $569!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uline Canada, ideal design (similar to Ikea ideal): $381&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leon&amp;rsquo;s: Quirky is sub $200, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leons.ca/collections/furniture-living-room-home-office-bookcases&#34;&gt;ideal designs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.leons.ca/products/palomar-open-bookcase-tuscany-brown&#34;&gt;over $400&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furniture.ca, ideal design: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.furniture.ca/products/yurok-5-shelf-bookcase-summer-oak&#34;&gt;$99.95&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the solution the government need to promote more competition which comes from enacting pro-competition policies AND actually directing funding to promote competition rather than &amp;hellip; solely funding and focusing on speculative innovation (e.g. EV Batteries, Quantum, AI subsidies that end up going to Nvidia and foreign cloud computing companies). When the government focuses on picking winners, it is essentially trying to predict how the future would be like, which would effectively be like predicting which stocks will have the highest earnings growth in 3 years. We see the failures of picking winners already, with the multiple closings of these EV battery factories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the Liberal government abolished Sustainable Development Technology Canada after the auditor general released a scathing report about the organization’s management last spring.
Of the projects she looked at, one in every six that received funding were ineligible. The auditor’s report also found 90 cases where conflict-of-interest polices were violated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Doug Ford. Renting a condo unit for less than the monthly mortgage your land lord pays? GRrr &amp;ldquo;fuck&amp;rdquo; Doug Ford. If rent control had existed, less housing would&amp;rsquo;ve been built, ensuring that land lords wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have lost so much money in the crash. I actually hate it when land lords lose money renting to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steven Harper. Housing affordability may have gotten worse during both Cretien/Martin (30%), and Trudeau (50%), but it&amp;rsquo;s Harper&amp;rsquo;s fault for letting it get 20% worse. Harper is to blame! He should&amp;rsquo;ve ran on housing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporations. What do you mean Carney is pro-TFWs? It&amp;rsquo;s actually the corporations fault for hiring the cheapest labour class legally available to them. Carney is not at fault. He&amp;rsquo;s a central banker. He is the most qualified person for the job. Poilievre would&amp;rsquo;ve done the same thing. He&amp;rsquo;s totally lying when he says he wants to end the TFW program. What do you mean he said it in August 2024. What do you mean the NDP ran on completely reforming the TFW program?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Danielle Smith. What do you mean she didn&amp;rsquo;t want the handmaid tale&amp;rsquo;s banned and that the author fell for the Edmonton school board propaganda. The author can never be wrong! She&amp;rsquo;s an author! Author&amp;rsquo;s are never wrong.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>RANT: Bike Share Toronto Sucks!</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bike-share-toronto-sucks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 12:05:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bike-share-toronto-sucks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in Toronto on the date of publishing and needed to go to a bar on college st but way east of the subway station.
The problem with the street cars in Toronto during winter is that they were stalled (street parked cars were blocking them)! So I decided to walk and halfway there, I decided I should be &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; and rent a bike. Bad idea, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t my time and my hands got cold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most egregious issue with bike share toronto is that the app did not accept my payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a full list of my issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three different debit/credit cards of mine did not work. I tried Wise, WealthSimple, which I will admit are Debits, however even  the NeoFinancial Credit Card did not work! I&amp;rsquo;ll have to add my BMO Business credit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The QR codes are letters and not links.This is a bad implementation because if the QR code was a URL, the app would still be able to parse it and users without the app could be redirected to install the app! Someone who does not know English might not understand how to get a bike. Therefore, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just an incompetent implementation, there is also an accessibility issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app asks for too much private information. For example my email, phone, and a password! Should be a simple OTP via email/phone, or none at all. Is the data of people who use these bikes being harvested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given that to pay you need to manually enter the card information, it&amp;rsquo;s stupid the app doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept Google Pay or PayPal. Lyft allows us to use PayPal. Why not something as simple as a bike rental app? I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Monero improves their integration UX. Imagine being able to rent a bike anonymously! That&amp;rsquo;s the future I dream of!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog post outlines some policies regarding housing that the Conservative Party of Canada leader Pierre Poilievre has announced or mentioned over the years. I shared an article a few days ago on r/canadahousing on Mark Carney&amp;rsquo;s 2024 opinion piece while he was a member of Canada’s Task Force for Housing &amp;amp; Climate. Overall, his article had stances but lacked substance of communicating a federal policy. Even now that he is a contender to be the next Prime Minister of Canada, his opinion piece is the best material regarding housing. Unlike Carney&amp;rsquo;s housing stances, all four of Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s stances  regarding housing are policies that the federal government can pursue. If there is a policy missing or newly announced, please contact me so I can add it to the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Summary of Mark Carney (March 2024) - Affordable Homes (Globe &amp; Mail)&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-we-all-deserve-affordable-homes-and-a-stable-climate-and-that-is/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20240902063815/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-we-all-deserve-affordable-homes-and-a-stable-climate-and-that-is/&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abolish parking minimums (reduces costs, probably done through HAF, but cities like Red Deer fall through)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low carbon intensity housing standards (lower operational costs, but does it increase costs to build)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pre-fabricated houses / mass timber (not really a policy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t build in high climate risk areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m impressed with his knowledge of home building however I&amp;rsquo;m left wanting more of an execution plan. If we were to include his recently announced policies regarding the carbon tax, Mark Carney&amp;rsquo;s policies would increase the cost to build condos because condos use steel and concrete, two industries he wants to tax more (industrial carbon tax). I&amp;rsquo;ll agree with him that mass timber is cool and should be used more, but that&amp;rsquo;s like telling people they should use Firefox and banning Google Chrome the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improves: rent affordability via demand-side policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-immigration-cut-population-growth-1.7308184&#34;&gt;CBC - Aug, 2024&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre said a future Conservative government would tie the country&amp;rsquo;s population growth rate to a level that&amp;rsquo;s below the number of new homes built, and would also consider such factors as access to health-care and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re unsure why this is good for housing affordability, consider that land lords exist and if condos are bought by land lords, they will have less people to rent them to, thus lowering rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre has previously said immigration levels should be tied to housing starts. The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) reported roughly 255,000 housing starts in July.
The federal government has already said it will admit about 485,000 permanent residents — immigrants who intend to settle here on a permanent basis — to Canada this year, with the target rising to &lt;del&gt;500,000 in both 2025 and 2026.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that after this CBC article was published, in October 2024, the incumbent Liberal government announced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2025-2027.html&#34;&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; in the temporary and permanent immigrant levels from 2025-2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

          &lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;NEW Permanent Resident Admissions&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;OUTDATED Permanent Resident Admissions&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2025&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;295,000&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;500,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2026&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;280,000&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;500,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2027&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;365,000&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;500,000?&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2025-27 Levels Plan projects a decrease in overall permanent resident admissions to 395,000 in 2025, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vOB7-dbYuCc&#34;&gt;explanation video&lt;/a&gt; from Canada&amp;rsquo;s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau admitting that temporary immigration was just not planned until 2024. My only criticism really is that the government took a whole year to react. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ll say they took almost 2 years to react, since the issues were apparent to both the Bloc and Conservatives in May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Pierre Poilievre confirmed he is supporting a Bloc motion to restrict immigration in the middle of a national labour shortage that hurts small businesses and communities across the country. He wants fewer immigrants to come to Canada; that means fewer skilled workers and fewer Canadians reuniting with family members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m referencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-critic-immigration-calls-out-conservative-leader-harmful-policies&#34;&gt;NDP&amp;rsquo;s criticism&lt;/a&gt; of Poilievre voting against immigration as evidence to prove Trudeau could&amp;rsquo;ve announced/pushed immigration cuts at least 17 months sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the minister of immigration, Mark Miller, boasting on Twitter regarding asking rents falling coinciding with a cut in non-permanent immigration. You cannot make this up. In one year, being against excessive immigration is harmful. The next year, it&amp;rsquo;s mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;“The deceleration in rents coincides with a significant cutback in net inflows of non-permanent residents.”👇 &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/l3mNfPZE2G&#34;&gt;https://t.co/l3mNfPZE2G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Marc Miller ᐅᑭᒫᐃᐧᐅᓃᐸᐄᐧᐤᐃᔨᐣ (@MarcMillerVM) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MarcMillerVM/status/1847612393452449997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 19, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improves: municipal housing reform (supply-side)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conservative.ca/just-the-facts-ndp-liberals-have-made-housing-unaffordable-for-canadians/&#34;&gt;NDP-Liberals Have Made Housing Unaffordable For Canadians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2023, the debate of housing on reddit was that the federal government was not responsible at all, and neither was the provincial government, and that immigration had nothing to do with rental affordability. Many people can agree with me that criticizing immigration was not taken seriously. Even in September 2022, Poilievre had a plan for ensuring that municipalities start taking housing seriously. Municipalities have ZERO incentive to build more. They do not even care about the Laffer Curve when it comes to raising tax revenue by lowering development charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Z39VZGF2k0A?t=608&#34;&gt;Pierre Poilievre C-31 Response @ 10:08&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[En Français] The conservative government will tie infrastructure dollars for major cities where properties are too expensive to the number of housing units built. This will help to reduce the cost of construction permits, allow us to build more, and we will insist that every time the federal government has a new transit station that the land around must have houses and apartments in order to densify so that people can live near public transit. And third, we will sell 15% of the 37,000 [5,550] federal buildings in order to transform them into housing and create millions and millions places for young people to live and start their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would this work and not the Housing Accelerator Fund (HAF)? Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s approach should theoretically work because the federal government has policies such as the Canada Public Transit Fund, where cities across Canada will be getting funding regardless of housing completions. Poilievre is saying that these cities should show they deserve the funding by contributing to making housing affordable (by ensuring supply increases in their cities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HAF on the other hand only makes deals with municipalities regarding reforms in exchange for money but does not force municipalities to lower developer charges, even though they increased them just before making a deal with the HAF. Additionally, the HAF deals as far as I can tell don&amp;rsquo;t have performance incentives either! So a municipality can make some reforms and get the money, without a year over year increase in completions. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cancea.ca/index.php/2023/06/27/an-uncomfortable-contradiction-taxation-of-ontario-housing/&#34;&gt;Taxation of Ontario Housing&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax burden on new housing in Ontario is 31% of the purchase price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governments make three times more than a builder of a new home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new home in Ontario has a tax burden twice that of the rest of the economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The federal government is the largest beneficiary of new housing at 39% share of tax revenues. It invests 7.1% in Ontario public infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is very interesting because imagine if only your income taxes are at 75% rate and when you ask for income taxes to be lower, people with much lower income taxes, maybe even people who are beneficiaries, are claiming you don&amp;rsquo;t deserve to make a living. That&amp;rsquo;s the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth point is relevant because the HAF is rightly increasing the Federal governments contribution to Ontario public infrastructure, however it does not come with the immediate relief of developer charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Deer is a perfect example of a city that would try it&amp;rsquo;s best to get a super bonus. They are doing everything wrong during a housing crisis. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/housing-infrastructure-communities/news/2024/06/active-and-public-transportation-infrastructure-upgrades-underway-for-communities-throughout-alberta.html&#34;&gt;The Canadian Pacific Railway bridge investment&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect example where Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s policy would&amp;rsquo;ve ensured indirectly that Red Deer slash their minimum parking requirements (2 per unit even if it&amp;rsquo;s a studio).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improves: land supply (supply-side)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous quote, Poilievre said he would release 5,550 federal buildings to be transformed into housing. This is definitely possible as this is done in some USA cities. Considering our housing affordability is much worse than the USA, &amp;ldquo;cost&amp;rdquo; is not a good argument against this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know we should go back in time and cancel the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station because nuclear energy &amp;ldquo;costs too much&amp;rdquo; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre has also mentioned selling federal land (probably just the land the buildings are on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6,000 buildings and thousands of acres of federal land&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Carney copied Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s idea to axe the GST under $1M, for only first-time home buyers mind you (which is a worse policy as it disincentivcizes up sizing, and implies that housing can only be made more affordable for new houses and not existing housing stock), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conservative.ca/poilievre-to-axe-gst-on-new-homes-under-1-3-million/&#34;&gt;Poilievre is running on a GST cut under $1.3M&lt;/a&gt;. The case for 1.3M seems to be for cities like Vancouver and Toronto, which does have higher than house prices over $1M. Combined with an HST cut, that&amp;rsquo;s around ~$150,000 in savings for a condo that priced at 1,300,000 pre HST cut which can now be lowered to 1,150,000 given that we are in a period where pre construction condos are not being sold due to prices being too high! For a $830,000 2 bedroom condo, it could now be priced at $734,000. Expect to see price changes once Poilievre or Carney are elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improves: primary residence affordability and housing construction competition via demand-side / pricing policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/W4N9ovBRYRg?si=gLaNqWIuDDT8NnTm&amp;amp;t=275&#34;&gt;First Announcement Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to have a rebate on the first $450,000 of a new home back when the GST was instituted three decades ago. That threshold was supposed to go up every year. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;. So everyone is basically paying GST on their new home. GST was not meant to apply to the basic necessities of food and housing. That&amp;rsquo;s why the exemption existed in the first place. It&amp;rsquo;s also why today, I am announcing that a Pierre Poilievre common sense government will axe the sales tax on new homes under a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear to me that Poilievre is talking about the same people eligible under the existing GST rebate and that his plan would not open up the doors to investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the last time the $450,000 GST rebate threshold was updated was when the GST was announced in November 1991. Using Statistics Canada&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810020501&amp;amp;pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&amp;amp;cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=11&amp;amp;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1991&amp;amp;cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=12&amp;amp;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2024&amp;amp;referencePeriods=19911101%2C20241201&#34;&gt;New housing price index&lt;/a&gt;, an index of 55.9 in November 1991 is 124.5 in December 2024. Doing some math &lt;code&gt;450,000 * 124.5 / 55.9&lt;/code&gt; nets us $1,002,236. Poilievre is right in saying that $1,000,000 is the new $450,000 just as $100,000 is the new $60,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thehub.ca/2024/10/16/mike-moffatt-title-federal-government-housing-gst/&#34;&gt;Mike Moffatt: One simple way the federal government could save Canadian homebuyers nearly $2 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Moffatt is also on the task force for Housing &amp;amp; Climate. Agreeing with Market Carney about his policies and then disagreeing with policies that Mike Moffatt supports is called being prejudiced (vice versa is also true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Mulroney government designed the GST, they recognized that it could harm housing affordability, so they designed a rebate system to “ensure that the new [GST] system does not pose a barrier to the affordability of housing in Canada.”
Since the average home price in Canada exceeds $700,000, very few new home sales qualify for any rebate whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;In 2022, the federal government returned only $410 million in rebates, collected on an estimated $5.5 billion collected, for a refund rate of 7.4 percent. In 1992, the rate was over 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;in 2024, GST collected on home construction for primary residence ownership homes will exceed $6 billion, and rebates will be under $300 million for a refund rate of under 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/fin/F2-85-1-1989-eng.pdf&#34;&gt;a quote&lt;/a&gt; from August 1989 by the The Honourable Minister of Finance, Michael H. Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To qualify for the tax rebate, the purchaser must be a resident of Canada. The new home must also be the purchaser&amp;rsquo;s principal residence. &amp;hellip;
The government will review these thresholds at least every two years and adjust them as necessary to ensure that they adequately reflect changes in economic conditions and housing markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very important quote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebate will substantially offset the impact of the tax on the vast majority of
new houses purchased in Canada. Indeed, over 90 per cent of purchasers of owner-
occupied new houses will be eligible for the maximum 4.5 percentage point rebate.
An additional 5 per cent of new homes will receive some rebate of tax. In total,
therefore, the housing rebate program will affect over 95 per cent of new house
purchases. As a result, the GST will not pose a barrier to the affordability of new
housing in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.conservative.ca/axe-the-sales-tax-on-homes/&#34;&gt;Axe The Sales Tax on Homes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-gst-new-homes-cut-1.7365339&#34;&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People buying new homes currently can get a rebate on the GST they pay of up to 36 per cent, to a maximum of $6,300, for homes valued at $350,000 or less.
For homes valued at more than $350,000 and up to $449,999, the rebate is gradually reduced until it reaches zero for homes that are $450,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat leaves us with a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also need a suite of supply-side reforms to facilitate the building of new homes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When non-conservative voters heard about this policy, they completely ignored Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s other policies, but that&amp;rsquo;s what this article is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sections prior we talked about how the current federal government is not mandating developer charges to be reduced in exchange for funding infrastructure. Well Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s entire shtick is that the federal government shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have a responsibility for infrastructure and thus should not collect the GST. If the housing GST revenue isn&amp;rsquo;t even being used to fund public infrastructure in Ontario, why does it exist? It&amp;rsquo;s a subsidy from home buyers to home owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre said he&amp;rsquo;ll balance the budget by cutting the Housing Accelerator Fund and Housing Infrastructure Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impose a NIMBY penalty on big city gatekeepers for egregious cases of NIMBYism. We will empower Canadians to file complaints about NIMBYism with the federal infrastructure department. When complaints are legitimate, we will withhold infrastructure and transit dollars until cities allow homes to be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Dismantling the PPC</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/ppc/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 15:12:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/ppc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PPC platform on housing is terrible! The PPC&amp;rsquo;s housing platform is so bad that even if immigration is reduced to 0, their other policies would result in less houses being built:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the Bank of Canada’s inflation target, from 2% to 0%. This will cool down inflation in all sectors, including housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strategies the Bank of Canada uses to reduce inflation, is by raising interest rates; the cost of borrowing is higher for both buyers and businesses. They don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue that cooling the housing market isn&amp;rsquo;t because housing becomes more affordable, but because higher interest rates reduce demand for housing at every price level and worse it also reduces supply at all levels. An inflation target of 0% could be good, but a housing shortage is not a good time to enact such a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect local and provincial governments’ responsibility for housing policies. They must be accountable to their citizens and not be subject to federal pressure to “densify” neighbourhoods of single-family homes in order to accommodate mass immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They completely disregard that SFH&amp;rsquo;s are actually Two-Family Houses in Brampton, Ontario. They think densification is a pressure by the feds as if green belt isn&amp;rsquo;t the reason we need to densify. Like seriously, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you only allow SFH&amp;rsquo;s, when basements get rented out. Do they want people to live in basements or do they want people to actually own their own unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privatize or dismantle the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a mammoth government agency that fuels the housing crisis instead of helping to cool it down. All it has ever done is encourage Canadians to buy houses they can’t afford, and accumulate massive amounts of debt that the federal government, and ultimately Canadian taxpayers, will be responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this platform is all about keeping housing out of reach. The platform completely disregards that there is a housing shortage, not a future demand issues. Without CMHC, people that put a lower downpayment have to pay higher interest rates since they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to get insured. Like what? Make housing even more out of reach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies simply aren&amp;rsquo;t that deep and their housing strategy is a huge gamble of thinking that new immigrants are capable of buying properties. Owning is ~50% more expensive than renting in the present. Reducing immigration only freezes the shortage; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian governments were not squeaky clean. While researching, the information I&amp;rsquo;ve come across point that both Liberals and Conservatives were not clean. Obviously, it was time for Harper to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liberal government was broadsided by allegations that officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, after repeated lobbying by SNC-Lavalin, tried to convince former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to strike a mediation deal instead of pursuing fraud and corruption charges against the Quebec-based engineering giant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is corporate cronyism from a party and its supporters who claim that the Conservatives do the bidding of Canadian corporations. Fun fact, telecom executives hated Steven Harper since he wanted to bring in Verizon from the US to compete with Canadian telecommunication companies. Harper lost votes for not following in line with the Canadian telecommunication companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Smith of Alberta did a similar thing by the way recently regarding a case where the defendant was blockading the border and being mischievous in general. Ethical commissioner deemed in incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mass graves were not actually mass graves yet the federal government created a whole federal holiday from it; reactionary virtue. It solved zero indigenous problems. There&amp;rsquo;s land disputes right now in BC where indigenous people are losing land they claim is theres to a pipeline company. If the federal government wants to claim it&amp;rsquo;s actually doing good for the indigenous people, then focus on issuing a statement so that there will be peace in that region instead of one side claiming that they are right and the other side which the court sides with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is when Trudeau could not be redeemed. First of all, there were so many restrictions. Doug Ford is not conservative either, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I never voted for him. He is no different than the federal Liberals. So what are the problems with COVID-19?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CERB: the government mandated lockdowns and then gave everyone free money. Of course this caused inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Overreach: Border Entry Restrictions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine forcing Canadians to get tested just to re-enter the country. Otherwise pay $6,000 to enter the country. Oh and then there&amp;rsquo;s random testing requirements as well. The only reason my family got through the border was because all of us were forced to get tested&amp;hellip;Let&amp;rsquo;s see here Canada, allow people who tested positive for COVID-19 in and make them mandatory, but if someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a test, assume they have something worse than being COVID-positive. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. The policy should&amp;rsquo;ve been: get tested negative to not have to quarantine, or else you are assumed to have covid and then you should quarantine. We had to do the COVID testing on a live video call. It was a waste of resources and front-line workers&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;awarding of a federal contract to WE Charity to administer the $912 million Canada Student Service Grant program (CSSG)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read that right. The federal government allows citizens to deduct charity donations yet gives money to charities that pay the family members of the prime minister. Absolutely disgusting. During COVID, the government should be taking over investment that the private industry would not be doing. We could&amp;rsquo;ve had such a big jump on the housing shortage, but nope, almost a billion dollars was apparently available for the Canada Student Service Grant program (CSSG) during one of the worst budget deficits ($327.7B) in this country&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what the program was for? Paying volunteers. That&amp;rsquo;s right, instead of sustainable jobs being created during a time of high unemployment, it&amp;rsquo;s better to just pay people to volunteer (service-based).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;participants will only be able to count hours accumulated from June 25 to October 31, 2020.
Having students conduct WE Charity work at a reduced wage in the form of volunteerism which was previously conducted by paid employees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a horrible program as you had to register by August 21, but could only count for a selected few months anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said that only WE Charity could administer this program, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other organizations, such as the Public Service Alliance of Canada and YMCA Canada, expressed skepticism at the claim that WE Charity was the only organization in Canada capable of administering the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was $60M for a an app that didn&amp;rsquo;t let me into the country and enjoy my full rights anyways (2022). Today though, ArriveCAN is a great app now that COVID-19 is over. Advance Declaration can be used for express border entry. I guess $60M for express border entry is not the worst thing that has happened. This issue wasn&amp;rsquo;t about the money though, it&amp;rsquo;s about the ethics behind procurement (non-competitive bidding which was justified by calling COVID-19 a threat to national security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the accountability? The non-technical firm of two people, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gc-strategies-arrivecan-1.7120381&#34;&gt;GC Strategies&lt;/a&gt; got a quarter of a billion dollars since the Liberals came into power. The company would keep 15-30% as a commission to subcontract the awards it would get. How is a system so poor that a contractor can take a higher commission than what Apple and Google take from their respective mobile app stores?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;housing-and-immigration&#34; &gt;Housing (and Immigration)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#housing-and-immigration&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, housing and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing to income ratios are the highest they&amp;rsquo;ve been. Canada with a population of 40 million has an index 148.16, followed by Germany at 140.6, where most people rent and the population is 83.2 million. We have more land!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record international students that were not vetted and were sold a lie. The company funneling this, ApplyBoard, unfortunately has University of Waterloo founders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration itself is out of control. Canada needs 200,000 per year to make up for the low birth rate, but what Canada does not need is a skewed gender ratio and neither does it need 471,550 immigrants excluding students. The net migration was over a million people (add non-permanent residents)&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing shortage in Canada is due to NIMBYism. NIMBYs want to prevent urban sprawl but at the same time do not want houses to be denser. This, combined with a growing population causes a housing shortage. The solutions are simple, reduce immigration, reduce inflation (and thus interest rates), create new cities, allow both urban sprawl and density (both solutions are better than one), and lastly, increase the efficiency of the LTBs so that more people are open to land lording and not just corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, paying a percentage in taxes on items your purchase is not enough. With HST of 13%, a $100 item has a tax of $13, and a $100,000 item has a tax of $13,000. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for the government. Not only is it not enough, the good being purchased can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ltn2/subject-vehicles-under-select-luxury-items-tax-act.html&#34;&gt;affect the rate too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if rich people want to bid up the price of investment properties past a million dollars, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Only above $3,000,000 is it a problem. But if you, a middle class, person, purchase a modest home, save money your entire life want to purchase a corvette while your going through your midlife crisis, nope please pay an extra 20% on the amount over 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For boats, it&amp;rsquo;s above $250,000! This is insane. So I get punished for having just a car, but the person who splurges on both cars and a boat, gets away with it. This is ridiculous, and this tax is too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why tax vehicles but not Richard Milles or other luxury watches? Why not all jewelry? Or cottages? Or art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wonder why real GDP per capita is rarely growing, and it&amp;rsquo;s because the government thinks that the economy can improve even when taxes are known to reduce demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/03ffbeef04658a0828c035bec9ef4b2e7a4de065014f64918bc50a6afca3b043&#34;&gt;PBO Commentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added the luxury tax and made it very opinionated. Any motor vehicle worth over $100,000+  even if its electric like the Porsche Taycan or Tesla Model S. You are forced to buy a Model 3, Y, X if you want a family electric car that is good. Aircrafts also over $100,000. Vessels though? That&amp;rsquo;s right, only over $250,000, because someone who can afford a family car and a $200,000 boat is actually less rich than the person who just wants a Lexus LC 500, Corvette C8, Porsche Taycan, Porsche Panamera, Porsche 911. Rich people who own houses worth over $1,000,000? Not only do you not pay a luxury tax on homes priced above $2,000,000, you also don&amp;rsquo;t pay capital gains tax if your house appreciated by $1,000,000. Even a secondary home is not taxed, because owning cottages is more middle class than buying those luxury cars I listed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During COVID, the Trudeau administration allowed businesses to take a $50,000 loan and if they repaid $30,000 &amp;ldquo;early,&amp;rdquo; $20,000 will be forgiven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 1,190,000 small businesses in Canada. So that&amp;rsquo;s 23,800,000,000 in FREE MONEY WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this devalues the currency, and as of 2024, it is clear the Trudeau administration messed up as the CAD is losing against the USD now that interest rates are being cut. If fiscal policy was managed better, then the FX rate would&amp;rsquo;ve been much stronger in 2022 during the interest rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is in a recession in 2025. Our currency rate is worse than the crash in March 2020. This is horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill C-75 requires police to “release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering certain factors which include the likelihood the accused will attend court, the imminence of the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system,” the organization [Victoria police] posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Bill C-75] established a principle of restraint which favoured release on bail at the quote &amp;rsquo;earliest reasonable opportunity on the least onerous conditions,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/new-bail-reform-law-wont-make-communities-safer-experts-1.7077332&#34;&gt;Source from CBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill C-48 was brought in to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; these issues. However, the conservatives claim this is too weak and have used the murder of Tori Dunn by Adam Troy Mann as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40-year-old was homeless and living in a tent in the bush in Chilliwack after being released on bail pending the outcome of two robbery charges.
The Crown wanted Mann sent to jail for 45 days, a position the judge said was &amp;ldquo;not unreasonable, but perhaps a bit harsh considering what occurred here and the expression of remorse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/murder-home-invasion-bail-1.7265125&#34;&gt;Source from CBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Bill C-48 isn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough because it allows activist judges from controlling weather criminals who break probation and have a history of violent crime can be let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opted instead for a 21-day sentence — which left only 10 days for Mann to serve after accounting for time already spent in jail following his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on June 5th, the judge reduces the jail time from 45 days to 21-days, which means Mann is free on June 15th, and kills Dunn on the 16th. It&amp;rsquo;s a clear case that a longer jail time was reasonable. I&amp;rsquo;d argue this judge needs to lose their job over such an egregious mistake. The conservatives and many people are arguing that violent offenders should not be granted bail at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-letter-bail-reform-tori-dunn-1.7271818?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar&#34;&gt;Premiers send letter to feds demanding bail reform after homicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the provincial and territorial leaders want the federal government to look at bail reform Bill C-48 passed earlier this year.
B.C. Premier David Eby says he wants Ottawa to examine gaps in the bail reform bill passed earlier this year. (Ethan Cairns/CBC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very clear that under Trudeau not enough is being done about violent offenders and because of a publication ban, we don&amp;rsquo;t even know why the judge granted bail, nor who the judge that granted bail is. It&amp;rsquo;s very sad that a first world country can&amp;rsquo;t get their shit together on REPEAT offenses. This isn&amp;rsquo;t about crime prevention, it&amp;rsquo;s about doing the bare minimum to protect innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lied about ending first past the post. Even when exploring alternatives, his party and followers were apprehensive about ranked voting, which is not good for proportional representation at a national view. Ranked is good for mayoral elections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only did he not keep his promise for affordable housing for Canadians, rent become parabolic. &lt;a href=&#34;https://liberal.ca/trudeau-promises-affordable-housing-for-canadians/&#34;&gt;https://liberal.ca/trudeau-promises-affordable-housing-for-canadians/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&amp;amp;GeographyId=2270&amp;amp;GeographyTypeId=3&amp;amp;DisplayAs=Table&amp;amp;GeograghyName=Toronto&#34;&gt;https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&amp;amp;GeographyId=2270&amp;amp;GeographyTypeId=3&amp;amp;DisplayAs=Table&amp;amp;GeograghyName=Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn’t stop Doug Ford from allowing colleges to ask for so many international student visas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill C-21, which demonized sports shooters. The NDP was only against this because it affected indigenous people, not because it affected non-indigenous Canadians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He enacted authoritative border policies during the pandemic where Canadians were forced to get results of a COVID test just to enter the country, or pay a fine, or get mandatory testing anyways. If you tested positive, you would still be let into the country but have to quarantine, but if you didn’t get tested, you would have to pay $6,000 instead of just being forced to quarantine. It was one of the most irrational policies I’ve ever been subjected to in this country. The only reason we had to leave the country was because a family friend was mourning the death of her husband.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He keeps lying about the carbon tax omitting that it has an economic impact. Instead of using the carbon tax to actually reverse emissions, the money is given back even though the economic impact is worse for most. Additionally, there’s a $1B slush fund but there were conflicting of interest issues. There’s no priority to make Canada the number one nation in carbon capture technology. We already have a carbon tax, so investing it into carbon capture technology is a no brainer. If I was the prime minister, I’d be building so many of these carbon capture plants in cities in Canada that lack jobs. The average GDP per capita in Canada is not found everywhere in Canada. There are many small towns with a sense of abandonment and a lack of blue collar jobs. It’s just filled with one Tim Hortons, an ice cream parlour, and some small houses. Lots of wild life, but a severe lack of housing so only a limited number of people can enjoy it. The government should actively force governments to deregulate zoning in exchange for building these carbon capture plants that will bring in sustainable jobs. Furthermore, the government can inform its citizens how to properly measure how much emissions they are responsible for and allowing us to pay money to these carbon capture crown corporations in exchange for a tax credit deduction similar to charities and political donations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He keeps pushing for bills such as the online harms bill that result in more bureaucracy to regulate the Internet for speech that is already illegal. In Canada hate speech is already illegal, that Chilliwack woman was arrested by the RCMP! The bill is expected to cost us $200M when we don’t even have a balanced primary budget (the budget excluding interest payments). We also spend $30B annually for non-recurring indigenous reparations. Immigrants who didn’t colonize nor oppress Indigenous are paying taxes to correct mistakes made by the ancestors of wealthy Canadians who have been in the country for hundreds of years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He uses terminology such as people kind to intentionally divide and rattle people up. He could have used humankind. Regardless “mankind” is not sexist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows the LMIA system to go wild without clampdowns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let 10,000 H1Bs come into Canada and essentially steal away jobs from Computer Science graduates from the University of Waterloo who paid $80,000+ across 5 years only to end up unemployed or getting a job that pays 80,000 in 2024. In 2019, before joining university my new grad income goal was 100,000 in 2019. That’s 118,321 in 2024 terms. Although I am outdoing my goals, my friend is not only just below this, he is also paying 1900 in rent for a studio. According to CMHC, rent for a bachelor across Canada is “1414” and in 2019 it was “1142.” So essentially, he is paying 1900 instead of 1347 (inflation adjusted rent), which is a loss of $6636. So the adjusted income software engineers from UW should be making is $125,000. The only reason I exceeded my income goals is because I’m ambitious and used niche technology. We shouldn’t all have to be Leetcode gods just to make a living for our skillsets (i.e. working for a high frequency trading firm). Also not all of us with the same skill level will get job/internships at mid market cap firms or big tech. Furthermore, the barriers to starting a company are insane. Not only do I have to deal with my parents’ expectations of working a normal job, there’s barely any way to pay rent if I want to go against my parents’ wishes. Ideally, accelerators should give you a grant equal to 1.5 years worth of living expenses. This translates to at most $41400 in today’s terms, but if rent was at 2015’s levels (937 or 1200 in 2024), then the grant would only need to be at most $27,000. The minimum a grant should be is for 1 years worth of leg room or $26,400 in 2024 and $18,000 if rent was $1200/mo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the pandemic the Liberal government issued many bonds to the central bank and instead of investing in jobs to pay people to produce goods and services and wealth, it was just issued to people who claimed to have been impacted. This is why I believe that the government should only expand in times of distress and recessions, as unemployment is two-fold. One is from the mismatch ratio of businesses to humans, which causes a labour surplus, and the other is due to a matching issues where businesses are looking for people with certain skills and are unable to find them and people with certain skills are available but no jobs exist for them. When the government hires, they are bound to the charter of rights and freedoms and are to set an example of what it means to be a good employer. What this means is that even if the private industry only hires experienced workers, the government who sets the minimum wage must be the employer of last resort which forces businesses to compete for these now experienced workers via a higher wage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNC-Lavellin Scandal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-attorney-general-snc-lavalin-1.5014271&#34;&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-attorney-general-snc-lavalin-1.5014271&lt;/a&gt; . This company (now known as AtkinsRéalis) had lobbied the government to introduce deferred prosecution agreement, which allows for financial penalties in lieu of criminal conviction, however the prosecutor must not weigh economic impacts of a conviction when pursuing charges. Trudeau was directly involved in pressuring the attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould to secure a deferred prosecution agreement. In my humble opinion, bribing foreign nations, especially developing countries, should not be illegal, especially if its towards the existing government. Why should Canada be concerned whether leaders of foreign states are accepting bribes? That&amp;rsquo;s on their constituents. It&amp;rsquo;s either to bribe, or to lose business because some other companies bribe. It&amp;rsquo;s no different than charging royalties and using windfall taxes. It&amp;rsquo;s a cost of doing business. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/libya-snc-1.5014939&#34;&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/libya-snc-1.5014939&lt;/a&gt; . There is no ethical qualms about bribing someone. There is 100% moral qualms about accepting bribes. Ethically speaking, bribing someone is a tax. The person is forcing you to pay a bribe to get something done. What is funny is that lobbying is no different. The Liberals did include the DPA because SNC lobbied the Liberals. The government is a hypocrite for allowing lobbying, safe name for bribing, but not for paying a non-standard tax in a foreign nation. Honestly speaking, any body who accepts donations from corporations and actually does what they are lobbying for is corrupt. SNC isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem, Gadaffi is. From a Libyan perspective, they are simply taxing a foreign state. It would actually be embezzlement if Gaddafi was taking that &amp;ldquo;bribe&amp;rdquo; for himself and not the states chest. Still these are issues of developing countries. The only way to defend a stance of disallowing foreign bribing is if there was also a condition that any foreign political actor who forces a Canadian corporation to be bribe will automatically be internationally charged. That is how you do things. It does not matter though, because with Monero, there will be no financial paper trail that a bribe even occurred. Trust is something that is enforced on onesself, not on others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacationing at his billionaire friends&amp;rsquo; islands because billionaires maintain friends with people who tax the rich right? It&amp;rsquo;s clear that his policies harm the middle class who want to experience a luxurious life style, and limit access to this luxury to people who are 10x richer who can easily afford these goods. That&amp;rsquo;s why the tax is high enough for the middle class to be dissuaded from purchasing these goods, but not high enough that individuals with a net worth over $100M question the purchase. If the government wants to impose a luxury tax, then make it applicable to cars that aren&amp;rsquo;t bought by the middle class. And make it 100% instead of the rate it currently is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of living is insane, nationally. Blame Russia or claim its ubiquitous worldwide, however nothing is being done to alleviate the pain by investing in industries which are the blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WE charity scandal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding answering questions and instead repeating the same generic lines. just watch him in Parliament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried to force Meta and Google to pay for simply sharing news links. If you share a news link through Meta&amp;rsquo;s app, the other user cannot even click on it because Meta will block showing it. Our regulations are so ridiculous that companies just do a full no no. This is what happened with AI with Meta not releasing their models in the EU, even though this is all digital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1B green slush fund scandal. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sustainable-development-technologies-canada-champagne-1.6985847&#34;&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://businessincalgary.com/regular-contributors/more-hush-than-trust/&#34;&gt;Business Calgary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Trudeau is very inauthentic when he speaks. It is always speaking down and never speaking at the same level as us. Want proof? In a town hall, a woman who asked a genuine question about mental health services for English speakers got an answer in French&amp;hellip;The rationale was because they were in Quebec and most people were French speakers. A town hall is a chance for citizens to get answers to their number one question for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Corruption in Canada</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/corruption-in-canada/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 22:29:02 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/corruption-in-canada/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a list of topics and links that show how corrupt Canada can be at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/governors-general-billed-over-88000-in-clothing-to-taxpayers-since-2017-documents&#34;&gt;Governors general billed over $88,000 in clothing to taxpayers since 2017: documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO of BC Housing Scandal was married to the CEO of Atira, which is a non-profit that gets funded by BC housing. On top of the egregious conflict of interest that was allowed by the board of directors, Atira sometimes won contracts without any bidding involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion%2Fgerard-comeau-beer-smuggler-and-our-new-national-hero/article37258839/&#34;&gt;Canada&amp;rsquo;s beer smuggler is our new national hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R v. Comeau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the police of New Brunswick conducted a sting operation that resulted in a $300 ticket. What for? Simply for &amp;ldquo;smuggling&amp;rdquo; alcohol across province lines. Comeau had purchased cheaper beer in Quebec and brought it back to New Brunswick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iedm.org/sites/default/files/web/pub_files/Ipsos_poll1117_en.pdf&#34;&gt;Ipos&lt;/a&gt;, 78% of 1,100 Canadians surveyed, think people should be allowed to buy any amount of alcohol from another province and bring it back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is evidence that Canada is a broken democracy. Even when the majority of people want something, the minority in power will make decisions that go against the beliefs and values of Canadians under some excuse they inevitably come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First past the post can probably be blamed to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Post does not even link to the report. They just pick out one number. Sure the government is in the wrong, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t do a better job reporting on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the economy is $1T, and the government is spending $1T, then 50% of the economy is done inefficiently. Canada is almost a communist country.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Abuse? Regarding the Steven Crowder Video</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/steven-crowder-emotional-abuse/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/steven-crowder-emotional-abuse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the latest revelation of Steven Crowder&amp;rsquo;s improper behaviour towards his almost ex-wife shown in the article linked in the tweet below, it&amp;rsquo;s very clear that a considerable portion of people (at least on the internet) are poor at comprehending what abuse is. I&amp;rsquo;ve transcribed the video into text using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openai/whisper&#34;&gt;openai-whisper&lt;/a&gt; and attached it at the bottom for your reference as the website linked is very bloated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;1. EXCLUSIVE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve obtained over three minutes of video of Steven Crowder being emotionally abusive toward his pregnant wife, Hilary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement sent to me, her family says she hid the emotional abuse she was dealing with for years. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/U28rGt2aSH&#34;&gt;https://t.co/U28rGt2aSH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/ZN8ai04fvK&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZN8ai04fvK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1651645370898989057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 27, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What disheartens me the most is that some of the users who are refusing to condemn this behaviour towards a spouse label themselves proudly as Christian. I used to call myself a Christian but one of the reasons I left Christianity is the refusal of the community, priests, bishops, and pope to explicitly classify what is wrong and the blatant hypocrisy when it comes to practical real life instances of injustice when actions aren&amp;rsquo;t barred by the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me clarify what abuse is and what emotional abuse is. One definition of abuse is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;speak in an insulting and offensive way to or about (someone).
&amp;ldquo;the referee was abused by players from both teams&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being abusive in this context isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly correct because a hockey player being abusive towards a referee when losing does not exactly make the hockey player evil. So we have to use a more stricter definition that gives weight to &amp;ldquo;emotional.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to define &amp;ldquo;emotional abuse&amp;rdquo; is to use the definition given by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-emotional-abuse/&#34;&gt;National Domestic Violence Hotline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want you going out with them. I trust you; I just don’t trust them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NDVH&amp;rsquo;s first example is an example that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even show narcissism or victim blaming. Crowder told his pregnant wife to not take the car because he might need to go to the gym. He instead told her to get an Uber and considered her calling a friend to pick her up a threat. It would only be considered a threat to someone with a guilty consciousness. In what world is &amp;ldquo;okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll call my friend to pick me up&amp;rdquo; a threat? Only in the real world where you are entitled to a car over your pregnant wife and want her to take an uber but are not okay taking an Uber yourself. The entitlement itself makes Crowder a bad person, but his dictation to not take the car plus the &amp;ldquo;threat&amp;rdquo; comment makes this emotional abuse. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going against me? How could you&amp;rdquo; is a classic playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional abuse includes non-physical behaviors that are meant to control, isolate, or frighten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest red flag is that Crowder, who earns more money in one month than my parents do in one year and earns more in one year than our family is worth, has one car whereas my family has two cars. The cheapness argument cannot be used since there&amp;rsquo;s a literal pool in the backyard. Some people might give the situation the benefit of the doubt that the second car was in the shop, but then two partners should be accommodating instead of saying &amp;ldquo;feeling some constraints&amp;rdquo; in the tone a 6 year old uses. He says that he &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t go to the gym&amp;rdquo; but then says he &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t be at home,&amp;rdquo; which at first it may allude to the wife controlling him, but the last comment just means that it&amp;rsquo;s a figure of speech not literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asserts that his wife is not doing &lt;em&gt;wifely&lt;/em&gt; things, and ignoring that gender roles don&amp;rsquo;t exactly exist, his idea of &lt;em&gt;wifely&lt;/em&gt; things is a pregnant woman carrying wooden pallets and a grill?? Hello? My parents get groceries together every week or two. They only go alone if there&amp;rsquo;s something missing that they themselves need or if the person who is busy can&amp;rsquo;t get themselves. It is absolutely absurd to assume your spouse can read your mind and go to the grocery store to get it for you. Even when his wife says that she will get the things he needs, he says &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either,&amp;rdquo; so clearly the issue is that he just doesn&amp;rsquo;t want her to take the car and come back at an unknown time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another comment that stuck out is &amp;ldquo;Do you understand the difference between my life being set to the second and you&amp;rsquo;re going to be back when your back&amp;rdquo; as if his wife is the one telling Crowder what to do but his later comment especially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Walk the dogs and put on some gloves&amp;rdquo; to show her commitment to him. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about everyone else, but I don&amp;rsquo;t tell people to do things for me that I can do myself. I usually say &amp;ldquo;Could you do this for me&amp;rdquo; and I definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask my pregnant wife to walk the dogs and put some gloves on (in reference to her concern that touching the medication is toxic to pregnant women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the video was harder to watch a second time since it goes against everything my parents taught me about ethics and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much done trying to convince people that Steven Crowder is completely in the wrong here regardless of if his wife was being controlling outside of the video (p.s. he wasn&amp;rsquo;t at the hospital when she gave birth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Transcription&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what was said, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful as a guideline to watch the speech I referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:00.000 --&amp;gt; 00:06.000]  Because I drew a boundary. I drew a boundary. No, no, you just did it. You just did it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:06.000 --&amp;gt; 00:10.000]  I drew a boundary in abuse of control. You were not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:10.000 --&amp;gt; 00:16.000]  Because if you refuse to do rightful things, then I will go pick up the grocery.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:18.000 --&amp;gt; 00:23.000]  Steaks, wood pellets, my grill. I know it&amp;#39;s not a reasonable workbook.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:23.000 --&amp;gt; 00:27.000]  But I&amp;#39;ll go do it. How about a huge purse?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:27.000 --&amp;gt; 00:29.000]  How do you respond to that?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:29.000 --&amp;gt; 00:32.000]  Other than that, I&amp;#39;m the man.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:32.000 --&amp;gt; 00:38.000]  I don&amp;#39;t know. Other than that, I&amp;#39;m the man.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:38.000 --&amp;gt; 00:40.000]  No, you&amp;#39;re not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:40.000 --&amp;gt; 00:42.000]  You&amp;#39;re not taking the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:42.000 --&amp;gt; 00:44.000]  Then I will ask them to pick up the car.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:44.000 --&amp;gt; 00:46.000]  What would you like them to ask?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:46.000 --&amp;gt; 00:47.000]  Oh, that&amp;#39;s right.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:47.000 --&amp;gt; 00:49.000]  Give it an Uber.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:49.000 --&amp;gt; 00:52.000]  Okay, Stephen, I can&amp;#39;t.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:52.000 --&amp;gt; 00:54.000]  Feeling some constraints?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:54.000 --&amp;gt; 00:56.000]  Stephen, I can&amp;#39;t see them.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:56.000 --&amp;gt; 00:59.000]  Listen to me. You want to walk out right now? Listen to me.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[00:59.000 --&amp;gt; 01:02.000]  I can&amp;#39;t go to the gym. I can&amp;#39;t go to my parents. I can&amp;#39;t call my friends.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:02.000 --&amp;gt; 01:05.000]  I can&amp;#39;t go. I can&amp;#39;t be home. You&amp;#39;re going to take the car and leave me here.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:05.000 --&amp;gt; 01:07.000]  Hillary, just think of how boxed in you&amp;#39;ve made me.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:07.000 --&amp;gt; 01:10.000]  What do you need me to pick up? I&amp;#39;ll get it. I&amp;#39;ll be back when I&amp;#39;m back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:10.000 --&amp;gt; 01:13.000]  No, that doesn&amp;#39;t work either or you&amp;#39;ll be back when you&amp;#39;re back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:13.000 --&amp;gt; 01:15.000]  It doesn&amp;#39;t work either.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:15.000 --&amp;gt; 01:20.000]  Do you understand the difference between my life being set to the setting and you&amp;#39;re going to be back when I&amp;#39;m back?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:20.000 --&amp;gt; 01:22.000]  Stephen.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:25.000 --&amp;gt; 01:28.000]  The only way out of this is disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:28.000 --&amp;gt; 01:30.000]  It&amp;#39;s the only way out of this when we&amp;#39;re at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:30.000 --&amp;gt; 01:32.000]  You&amp;#39;re going to be back.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:32.000 --&amp;gt; 01:34.000]  Good. Because you can&amp;#39;t have any disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:34.000 --&amp;gt; 01:36.000]  There you go.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:36.000 --&amp;gt; 01:38.000]  You throw your hand. You give up so easily.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:38.000 --&amp;gt; 01:39.000]  I don&amp;#39;t give up so easily.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:39.000 --&amp;gt; 01:40.000]  You give up so easily?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:40.000 --&amp;gt; 01:42.000]  I just said the only way out of this is disciplinary stuff.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:42.000 --&amp;gt; 01:44.000]  You said then we&amp;#39;re at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:44.000 --&amp;gt; 01:46.000]  No, we are at an impact.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:46.000 --&amp;gt; 01:48.000]  I love you, but Stephen.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:48.000 --&amp;gt; 01:50.000]  Your piece is sick.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:50.000 --&amp;gt; 01:52.000]  Your piece is sick.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:52.000 --&amp;gt; 01:54.000]  Watch it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:54.000 --&amp;gt; 01:56.000]  Fucking watch it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:56.000 --&amp;gt; 01:58.000]  I&amp;#39;m going to let go.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[01:58.000 --&amp;gt; 02:00.000]  I&amp;#39;ll get what you need me to get.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:00.000 --&amp;gt; 02:02.000]  And I need some space.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:02.000 --&amp;gt; 02:04.000]  You need to just talk to me a little bit.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:04.000 --&amp;gt; 02:06.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:06.000 --&amp;gt; 02:08.000]  I love you very much.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:08.000 --&amp;gt; 02:10.000]  I don&amp;#39;t love you. That&amp;#39;s the big problem.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:10.000 --&amp;gt; 02:12.000]  I&amp;#39;ve never received love from you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:12.000 --&amp;gt; 02:14.000]  And the fact is when I go, look, I need an A, B, C, and D.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:14.000 --&amp;gt; 02:16.000]  You just be disciplined about it.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:16.000 --&amp;gt; 02:18.000]  But I love you more than life itself.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:18.000 --&amp;gt; 02:20.000]  Okay, put on some gloves.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:20.000 --&amp;gt; 02:22.000]  No, but I love you more than life itself.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:22.000 --&amp;gt; 02:24.000]  That&amp;#39;s not fair. That&amp;#39;s not fair. And it&amp;#39;s disingenuous.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:24.000 --&amp;gt; 02:26.000]  Hillary, you&amp;#39;re right.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:26.000 --&amp;gt; 02:28.000]  Right in the ass.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:28.000 --&amp;gt; 02:30.000]  Become someone who&amp;#39;s needed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:30.000 --&amp;gt; 02:32.000]  Day in and day out.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:32.000 --&amp;gt; 02:34.000]  Worthy of a life.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:34.000 --&amp;gt; 02:36.000]  No, not of the life.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:36.000 --&amp;gt; 02:38.000]  Hillary, come on now.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:38.000 --&amp;gt; 02:40.000]  I&amp;#39;m not going to engage. I&amp;#39;m not going to engage anymore.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:40.000 --&amp;gt; 02:42.000]  I&amp;#39;m going to go. I&amp;#39;ll get what you need.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:42.000 --&amp;gt; 02:44.000]  I&amp;#39;ll get what you need.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:44.000 --&amp;gt; 02:46.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:46.000 --&amp;gt; 02:48.000]  I commit it to you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:48.000 --&amp;gt; 02:50.000]  I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:50.000 --&amp;gt; 02:52.000]  I commit it to you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:52.000 --&amp;gt; 02:54.000]  Fuck that.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:54.000 --&amp;gt; 02:56.000]  That&amp;#39;s the gloves.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:56.000 --&amp;gt; 02:58.000]  Are you committed enough to do these things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[02:58.000 --&amp;gt; 03:00.000]  Are you committed enough to do those things?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:00.000 --&amp;gt; 03:02.000]  You&amp;#39;re not committed to anything.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:02.000 --&amp;gt; 03:04.000]  You&amp;#39;re not committed to anything.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:04.000 --&amp;gt; 03:05.920]  You just said I love you.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:05.920 --&amp;gt; 03:08.000]  Walk the dogs front and closed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[03:08.000 --&amp;gt; 03:10.000]  Walk the dog front and closed.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article describes and demonstrates a novel solution for electoral reform called Fixed Seats Proportional Representation (FSP / FSP-R, previously called representative proportional voting) - similar to the open-list proportional representation system used by Finland - that it is practical to implement. It is also more effective in holding elections where every vote contributes to the formation of a government body. Below is the overall results of the 2021 Canadian general election under the presently used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;amp;dir=ces&amp;amp;document=part1&amp;amp;lang=e#p13&#34;&gt;First Past the Post (FPTP)&lt;/a&gt; electoral system compared to FSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve included this table at the top to highlight how ineffective the current electoral system is at giving voters a voice. From a numerical point of view, by analyzing each district, FPTP resulted in &lt;strong&gt;52.15% of all votes (8,883,902), NOT GOING TOWARDS AN ELECTED MP SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS!&lt;/strong&gt;. In contrast, under FSP, 99% of votes went towards an elected candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;Introduction
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Canadian general elections had just passed and I was curious as to how proportional the election results were. I noticed that the Liberals were over-represented. I then began a thought experiment on what an ideal democratic electoral process would look like for Canadian parliamentary elections. When the Liberal party led by Justin Trudeau came into power in 2015, one of their promises was electoral reform of the First Past the Post system currently in use. However, as the last elections have shown us, the Liberal party is substantially benefitting from First Past the Post and it is not strategic for them to follow through on their first campaign promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;party-list-proportional-representation&#34; &gt;Party List Proportional Representation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#party-list-proportional-representation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Canadians demand electoral reform without suggestions as to how, while others criticize common proportional voting system (e.g. party-list) for lacking &amp;ldquo;local representation.&amp;rdquo; There are also others asserting or even bringing up ranked ballots as the holy grail for democracy, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ranked-ballots&#34; &gt;Ranked Ballots
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ranked-ballots&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranked ballots work great when it&amp;rsquo;s just for one localized governance, such as mayor or a university student association. If it were applied to federal elections we would still not have proportional representation. Rather, we would see an amalgamation of parties most closely aligned (vote A if not vote B). Ranked voting is strategic voting and minority voters would still be &lt;strong&gt;unrepresented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fspr-overview&#34; &gt;FSPR Overview
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fspr-overview&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FSPR is similar to the open-list PR system used in Finland with two caveats being that independent candidates still have a chance and that the huntington-hill method is used to appropriate seats rather than the D&amp;rsquo;Hondt method. This new system is applicable to provincial/territorial &amp;amp; federal elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will vote for their preferred candidate and if they prefer an independent candidate, they can further rank these independent candidates and rank a party-affiliated candidate last, A run-off is held for votes going towards independent candidates are collapsed until the last independent candidate remains. An independent candidates can be elected if they win the First Past the Post manner. Otherwise, they are eliminated and the rankings go to party-affiliated candidates that were ranked last. The votes going towards each of the remaining party candidates are considered as party votes and are pooled for the region. The remaining seats are distributed proportionally based on which districts had the highest percentage support for each party (note that highest percentage support does not necessarily mean the popular vote in that district).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example to illustrate my point. Say that there is party A that would win the popular vote in every district, and party B which got the rest of the votes for each district. The seats party B and A are entitled to is determined in a round robin fashion of selecting the district that had the greatest percentage support for said party. The order is least seats to most seats to ensure that the smaller parties get districts they had high support in. Otherwise we might get a less than optimal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a province or territory that only has one seat, a ranked ballot with runoff would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;One possible criticism is that there will be ridings where the candidate that is elected didn&amp;rsquo;t get second or third either. This is a valid tradeoff since the current situation is that your vote would be meaningless if the representative of the other party got even one more vote than the party-affiliated representative you voted for. With my proposed FSP, all votes will matter even in hindsight. So the upsides are that: independent representatives are favoured, one of the running candidates will win the riding, every vote counts towards the governing body rather than only for a singular riding, and the democratically elected body is proportional to how voters voted.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To incentivize and protect independent candidates, we give independents priority when picking representatives for each riding. If they were to be included in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington-Hill_method&#34;&gt;Huntington-Hill&lt;/a&gt; method for proportional seat distribution, it would be possible for no seat to be allocated to them since party&amp;rsquo;s would have a greater proportion of votes. This is why I kept the same voting procedures / logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably hear people complaining about a non-FPTP candidate winning. No candidate should be entitled to represent a riding without 50% of support and a ranked ballot is not guaranteed to reflect the federal wide policies voters want. Therefore, FSP is a valid Canadian-centred compromise. I will now dive into the technicalities as well as the practical results if FSP was the system used in the last election.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fsp-algorithm&#34; &gt;FSP Algorithm
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fsp-algorithm&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is simply amazing that computer science can even be applied to politics. I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined the algorithm for FSP below. Note that this version of the algorithm and the election results distribute seats on a federal level rather than on a region level. I will update the algorithm and results soon. It incorporates many concepts such as FPTP, Huntington-Hill (fun fact is that it is used for the electoral college points in the U.S.A.), Hare Quota, and even ranked ballots (for niche situations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just like how it is presently, each person will vote for a candidate in their riding with some exception.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voters voting for an independent candidate are allowed to rank their preferences for independent candidates with their final choice optionally being a party-affiliated candidate. This ensures that their vote won&amp;rsquo;t be lost if no independent candidate won.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provinces &amp;amp; territories that only have one seat in the house of commons should be using ranked ballots. In this manner, voters of each province &amp;amp; territory get to choose best how their seats will be distributed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all the votes are counted per riding, determine independent candidates that won via the current FPTP method. Eliminate and use the ranking system to determine who the most popular independent candidate is. If they got a higher vote than the party candidates, then they win the riding according to FPTP. Otherwise, eliminate this independent candidate to get the number of votes for each party. Note that party candidates are not elected on a FPTP basis, which is why the party vote count is what is important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the ridings that were won by independent candidates from all available ridings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington-Hill_method&#34;&gt;Huntington-Hill method&lt;/a&gt; to determine number of seats to allocate to each party (independents are not considered a party).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_quota&#34;&gt;Hare quota&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether a party deserves a single seat; The total votes (minus independent votes) divided by the total seats available (after removing independent won seats).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially allocate one seat to each party that meets this quota and discard all parties and independents that did not meet this quota.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate seats to whichever party has the highest seat priority until total seats have been allocated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat priority is calculated using &lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A_n^2=\frac{V^2}{n(n+1)}&#34;&gt; where V is the the number of votes that party received, and n is the number of seats that party has been allocated so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign seats based on highest proportion of votes per riding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort parties in &lt;strong&gt;ascending&lt;/strong&gt; order based on number of seats allocated and prefer parties with higher votes to break ties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over the parties in the previous order until all parties have had their seats assigned to a riding.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each party that has unassigned seats, assign a seat to an unelected riding with the highest percentage voting for that party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a list or graph of all ridings with their assigned representative to keep track of seat assignment / election results.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first draft of this article in Nov-2021, however I wanted to show how the 2021 election would be different if FSP was used rather than FPTP before I shared FSP to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodology: I wrote Python code that downloaded 2021 election polling data, transformed that data to be useful, implemented the FSP algorithm, supplied data to the algorithm, and lastly summarized the results for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that under FSP, we can get a 99% representative government body where the 1% that went unrepresented voted for parties that got less than ~50,000 votes (Hare Quota).
For the list of ridings that would have a different representative, you can download &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elibroftw/representative-proportional-voting/releases/download/2021/districts.csv&#34;&gt;a CSV of the compiled results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable points are that all elected parties would have more seats than the proportional vote because 1% of votes went to very unpopular parties. The liberals lose 49 seats, NDP doubles their seat count, and the PPC ends up getting more than double the seats than what Green would get. This sort of system would force all parties to reach out to every voter even in districts that are considered wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a post-election analysis, numbers for some parties will be under-represented even though they won more seats. For example, it is common for voters to vote Liberals just so that the Conservatives don&amp;rsquo;t win and it&amp;rsquo;s possible some people voted Conservative instead of PPC so that the Liberals don&amp;rsquo;t win. Therefore, under FSP, we could reasonably expect bigger parties to lose even more seats to smaller parties. This logic does extend to parties on the same side of the spectrum such as the Green party. As seen in the CSV provided, we could see Green party getting seats that would have been NDP under FPTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSP would do away with strategic voting to the point where it would be ignorant to vote for a party other than the one you genuinely support. A greater proportional system
would also promote bootstrapping of parties as support only needs to be nation wide to win a seat rather than concentrated in one riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the FSP system, 99% of voters ended up represented. The votes of the 1%, although divided, do matter in aggregate. For example, the Free Party had just under the threshold to get a seat. Every vote really does matter under FSP compared to FPTP, where voting might have seemed like a waste of time in hindsight. Only under an FSP system would I ever support a policy that forced citizens to check into a polling station to vote or explicitly abstain from voting. There would be almost no subjective reasons to avoid voting under FSP as it would be in direct opposition to your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, every voter&amp;rsquo;s voice matters under FSP. If I was/am ever an MP or MPP, I would propose to use this method for all provincial/territorial and federal elections. I strongly believe that under FSP, Canada will be setting the standard for a democracy where each citizen&amp;rsquo;s voice is valued due to aggregation rather than the current system where a vote only goes as far as the district.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One criticism that I can see for my own method is that independent candidates are given a relatively unfair advantage to win their riding. However, an independent candidate will most likely lack the financial + labour + social resources
that party-affiliated candidates will have. Our country is considered a democracy even with the FPTP electoral system, so allowing independent candidates to make use of it in a reformed electoral system is really not a good argument especially when results are more democratic anyways. The majority of Canadians have not experienced something better than First Past the Post in the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSV file provided can be used to draw a colored map of each riding as well as to summarize which parties traded seats. For example, Conservatives went down 4 seats in total, but if you look at the CSV, half the seats lost were to the PPC and the other half to the NDP. They gained most of these seats back from the Liberals and some from the Bloc Québécois. Zero seats were lost to the Liberals. Another example is that the NDP lost two seats to the Green party and one seat to the PPC. That one seat is the only seat the PPC gained from a party other than the Conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that this type of system would force the mainstream parties to invite smaller parties to debates. Otherwise the smaller party voters would simply not watch the debates and vote for the smaller party anyways.
We know that the PPC got votes even with the backdrop of strategic voting, but only under FPTP does 5% round down to 0%. In a proportional system, all parties had more seats proportional than voters&amp;rsquo; choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a system countries like Norway use, however the main point is to make electoral reform easy, simple, and effective with minimal tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;electoral-misconduct&#34; &gt;Electoral Misconduct

    &lt;a href=&#34;#electoral-misconduct&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with every law and system, there will be people trying to bend it. One such situation I could forsee far into the future are candidates running as an independents but supported by a party through advertisements/funding. Elections Canada would be tasked at ensuring such &lt;del&gt;&lt;em&gt;faltugiri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/del&gt; horsing around would  be met with major fines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a good argument on whether or not proportional voting or democracy is even a good idea if the possibility of extreme actions can affect the majority of people. A good example that was brought up is that public transit doesn&amp;rsquo;t run all hours on Sabbath in Israel, but the minister of transportation is driven around in a car just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on some failures of proportional voting, parties that get less than 5% of the vote, should not get freebie seats, as in they should only be distributed seats where they properly won.
This ensures that any party with a minority of support nation-wide, is limited to representation where those views are the most popular. This is done to avoid scenarios where a &lt;em&gt;fringe&lt;/em&gt; party has leverage over the plurality led government which first past the post does effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seats should be distributed within a province not within the country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provinces &amp;amp; territories that only have one seat in the house of commons should be using ranked ballots. In this manner, voters of each province &amp;amp; territory get to choose best how their seats will be distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parties should meet the 5% threshold before they get to win seats they didn&amp;rsquo;t come first place in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/pierre-poilievre-policies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m making this blog post and video to document (practical?) policies that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard/read Pierre Poilievre express.
For each policy, I will include the excerpt as well as my analysis of it to connect the dots between stated policy and desired / expected results. This is evident in the first policy that incentivized me to create this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;housing-affordability&#34; &gt;Housing Affordability
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#housing-affordability&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Z39VZGF2k0A?t=608&#34;&gt;Pierre Poilievre C-31 Response @ 10:08&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[En Français] The conservative government will tie infrastructure dollars for major cities where properties are too expensive to the number of housing units built. This will help to reduce the cost of construction permits, allow us to build more, and we will insist that every time the federal government has a new transit station that the land around must have houses and apartments in order to densify so that people can live near public transit. And third, we will sell 15% of the 37,000 [5,550] federal buildings in order to transform them into housing and create millions and millions places for young people to live and start their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis: By tying infrastructure $ to # houses built for specific cities, cities will have a great incentive to allow more houses to be built, and since they want to get more net money, they would have to allow more permits, speed up constructions (possible by improving efficiency of inspections since the city itself isn&amp;rsquo;t the builder); To allow more permits, either costs go down so that more builders apply (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how expensive construction permits are but if they are 100k+ then yeah its a barrier to entry and causes higher housing prices), or approval process improves. A faster approval process means there is a greater incoming supply of housing every year. The next point is to INSIST not ENFORCE federal departments to build public transit stations around places where people live. The intention is to densify (true, cities like Toronto have low density compared to other cities) as areas with public transit are more desirable and thus more housing units will be built there (higher willingness to pay therefore higher incentive to supply). It&amp;rsquo;s important that this is an insist and not an enforcement to account for the &amp;laquo; rare &amp;raquo; case that near max densification and public transit has occurred. There will always be edge cases on building transit like for example planned development. So by saying insist and not enforce the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to add more bureaucratic measures. An enforcement would basically entail a/many new minister(s) in charge of approving every transit station proposed by the relevant department in charge of public transit (department of transportation?). Additional bureaucracy would be hypocritical for the CPC, specifically Poilievre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poilievre&amp;rsquo;s last point is to sell ~5,500 federal buildings and transform them into housing to create MM and MM&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of places to live, and this is an obvious hyperbole. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to put a fine number but if we assumed each of these buildings were to be replaced by an apartment, we could see 132 * 5,500 = 742,000 housing units. The 132 units per apartment building comes from Quora so the total units is ball park figure but better than a hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I myself had not thought of this policy and it&amp;rsquo;s great Poilievre came up with something new that can be summarized as bullying (my words not his) or incentivize cities into submission rather than trying to impede their municipal rights. This is a heck of a lot more practical than simply stating &amp;ldquo;we will increase construction permit approvals.&amp;rdquo; The policies I had come up with to address housing affordability can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/canada/#housing-affordability&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer carbon tax was axed on April 1st, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Poilievre has promised to axe the carbon tax without replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;C-69, the Impact Assessment Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court 4 years after it was passed! Only the Cedar LNG project has passed the IAA (in record time, and no doubt because of using BC as a substitute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-stay-in-your-lane-after-victory-against-bill-c-69-alberta-emboldened-in-feud-with-feds&#34;&gt;Constitutional challenge successful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Impact Assessment ACt (IAA) stipulates that an impact assessment is necessary when a &lt;a href=&#34;https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.75/page-1.html#1160090&#34;&gt;designated project&lt;/a&gt; (a physical activity on Canadian land and has been designated by the Minister of Environment. Where that list of regulations made for physical activities is? No idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much information on this topic, but from &lt;a href=&#34;https://atbcapitalmarkets.com/insights/the-bill-c-69-aftermath&#34;&gt;https://atbcapitalmarkets.com/insights/the-bill-c-69-aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, it seems Bill-69 could potentially create infinite delays; incorporate &amp;rsquo;traditional Indigenous knowledge&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors&amp;rsquo; which is ridiculous if the topic at hand is natural gas, oil sands, or a Uranium mine; THE MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS VETO POWER WITH EVERY PROPOSAL!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without any funding by corporations, being against this bill has merit. Poilievre is arguing from a point of improving energy independence, however I feel that the benefits are much more broader and not just restricted to energy. The bill supposedly impeding pipelines does have some merit as presently any pipeline proposal could be declined simply because the Minister of Environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t want it approved or stalled by the Governor in Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Impact Assessment Act protects the environment from projects like roads, which do exist by the way. If the Impact Assessment Act came before the major highways, it would take decades for the highways to even be built. Of course the &amp;ldquo;conservative&amp;rdquo; Doug Ford passed a bill that allows only highways to skip the Impact Assessment Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill C-395 was sponsored by Poilievre  in 2018 as a private member&amp;rsquo;s bill. The goal of this bill was to ensure that people with disability benefits could continuing receiving those benefits while working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that politicians need to be forced to keep the budget balanced in order to reduce debt and prevent excess aggregate demand (→ inflation).
Poilievre used the bill under Clinton as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GST cuts are needed because when the GST was first enacted, all new houses were covered under the $450,000 or so threshold. Of course, resale houses were selling for that much by the mid 2000s! In Ontario, after interest rates were hiked and temporary immigration turned off, investors have been spooked and are no longer willing to pay the same price for preconstruction condos. For years developer charges and housing prices went up faster than inflation, and now that prices are falling, developer charges are not! A GST and HST cut will ensure that these preconstruction houses can be sold at the market clearing price. As it stands now the price for the developer to profit at their hurdle rate is higher than the price that would clear the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am doubtful the country can create enough jobs in a short period of time to raise wages up and increase demand for housing, especially when these new builds are more expensive and less spacious than the existing housing supply that people who are willing to downsize live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropping the tax rate on the lowest income tax bracket from 15% to 12.75%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrasing means that the average Canadian will see their tax bill decrease by 15% due to how the nominal tax bill number actually changes compared to a small decrease in the actual rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the average Canadian worker earning $57,000 will save $900&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to read this is that anyone earning 57,000 or more will save $900 over the year in taxes or $34.61 per pay cheque. This covers my gym membership so I welcome it, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a deal-breaker to match Carney&amp;rsquo;s lower income tax cut.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 22:58:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/open-debate-platform/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to put all the details from my mind into this document, but hopefully
the spirit can be conveyed even if the technical design may be incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy cannot guarantee truth, but can be used to guide discussion &amp;hellip; under a set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-debate-platform&#34; &gt;Open-Debate Platform
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#open-debate-platform&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open-debate platform (ODP) or open-source debate, strongly inspired by open-sourcecode platforms, is about like minded users cooperating informally in order to produce formal arguments in a structured and multiple opinion debate. A debate in this context is simply a question asking for answers. The purpose is to converge and display answers. It&amp;rsquo;s about helping people
finding the truth without bias. If people want to know the best language to learn, they will probably be greeted with &amp;ldquo;English&amp;rdquo;
but if they don&amp;rsquo;t agree that the reasons apply to them, they can look at the next alternative and so on. The platform
allows for efficient analysis of all opinions and arguments. Parts of the implementation follow. I say parts, because there might be race conditions, but the purpose of this document is to communicate the spirit of ODP so that technical solutions can be used and created to preserve and scale this spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Controversy and Extremism&lt;/summary&gt;
Controversy and extremism is expected on a platform like this. The entire point is for an open discussion to
stamp out objectively wrong opinions. For example, murder is wrong; An argument pertaining to killing
would most likely delve into the definition of murder. However, the platform converges upon arguments that are
able to defend their position.
&lt;p&gt;Even though extremism will be present on the platform, uncivil discourse is not to be tolerated.
Civil discussion does not involve calls to genocide or targeting of innocent people. Such a statement would be suppressed,
however arguing whether such things are okay will be permitted. There is a difference between debating something
that is immoral vs. actually acting immorally. Since these arguments don&amp;rsquo;t actually dictate behavior, the ODP
does not have to follow any argument that is able to defend its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ODP can be structured more easily digitally than physically. So the specs are made with that in mind.
Of course, a paper system could replicate this although with unsustainable logistics and so would need to cut some corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;specs&#34; &gt;Specs
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#specs&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the spec, some features improve usability and user experience and are not required for the basic
implementation of an ODP. The basic is simply a platform that allows for the interactions described in the previous paragraphs.
One way to accomplish that is given below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-platform&#34; &gt;Digital Platform
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#digital-platform&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most likely a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website that acts as a host and a gatherer. A gather type system is decentralized but could take lot of technical effort to get right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The digital platform is run by an unbiased &lt;a href=&#34;#operator&#34;&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A biased operator invalidates ODP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can become &lt;a href=&#34;#user&#34;&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; by logging in with email or using public-private key signing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users to able to ask &lt;a href=&#34;#questions&#34;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform would have an ability to search and explore questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform supports a routing protocol like TOR and can be run with JavaScript disabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An operator is an entity that runs the ODP. Operators are to remove calls to harm. Harm is defined as anything equal to or more than a call to chastise people who haven&amp;rsquo;t acted uncivil in a &lt;strong&gt;formal&lt;/strong&gt; setting. Formality does matter. Unbiased means not using their opinion an a question to censor other opinions. For example, an operator might be pro-Monero, however that does not give them the right to impede and censor civil arguments by pro-bitcoin and pro-ethereum parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user&#34; &gt;User

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A user has the ability to interact with the platform and create questions, &lt;a href=&#34;#argument&#34;&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt;, upvote argument points, and comment in &lt;a href=&#34;#discussions&#34;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user that creates an argument is also its &lt;a href=&#34;#User::Author&#34;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; and one of its &lt;a href=&#34;#User::Maintainer&#34;&gt;maintainer&lt;/a&gt;.
A user can become a maintainer but not an author if they accept a maintainer invite from the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user cannot be an argument maintainer for a topic and also upvote another argument for the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;argument&#34; &gt;Argument
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#argument&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each question, there are responses; also called arguments.
Ultimately, users are responsible for siding with an argument, the platform is just a tool to facilitate open debate as the name conveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument has at least one reason&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument has rebuttals for the arguments next popular and next least popular argument&amp;rsquo;s points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;rebuttal considerations&lt;/summary&gt;
  Replies are to be made to at least 1 rebuttal within 2 weeks or the point/rebuttal will be marked as &#34;failed to defend point/rebuttal&#34;.
  Hence, points/rebuttals can be shown to the user sorted by points/rebuttals defended &amp;rarr; ongoing &amp;rarr; failed to defend.
&lt;p&gt;This time window feature is very important in order to force discourse. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make 1 rebuttal and never respond again. Every response to a rebuttal must address the rebuttal fully. Not addressing a rebuttal fully makes the rebuttal valid. In that way, points and rebuttals can follow a thread type of structure to allow multiple replies and rebuttals per point rather than batching all rebuttals for a point into one. For less popular arguments, operators are allowed to be lenient about the forced rebuttal rule. I&amp;rsquo;d say if there are more than 5 argument, the bottom 50% won&amp;rsquo;t need to comply with the forced discussion. This is because it&amp;rsquo;s more likely these projects are arguing with bad faith characters and so the operator can use their own prioritization method for rule violation reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each question, arguments should be sorted by number of upvotes. Upvotes are not an actual indication of quality, only of popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than 10 maintainers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users click an argument, they should be shown the list of points for that argument and rebuttals to those points by the other two projects. Arguments can also rebut other arguments that are more popular or less popular, but it does not force the other argument to reply. Replying to rebuttals is required for arguments that are beside each other in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Rogue Behavior Considerations&lt;/summary&gt;
Arguments can be recreated (forked) in case of rogue or dormant maintainers. Since people can change
their minds, even if they decide to mess up the old argument they were supporting, history can be restored by a maintainer
in the same argument or by a proponent through forks.
If done correctly, each point has an associated history and id for each point in history.
Then, the upvotes can be restored as long as the users have no upvoted something new, and that point id does not exist
in any older forks. This way, the damage of griefing is reduced. These are all technical discussions though that uphold the
spirit of ODP.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Bad faith considerations&lt;/summary&gt;
It is up to operators how to deal with arguing in circles; if people are arguing in circles it is best to close the rebuttal. Arguing in circles usually indicates one party is not acting in good faith. Rebuttals can be reported as irrelevant and will shadow ban
the user. Shadow ban in this context means that the user will see the platform as if their action was valid.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;discussions&#34; &gt;Discussions
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#discussions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions are informal communication features. They should be included for each argument, and each arguments merge requests.
Responses in discussions are called comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument discussions can be moderated &lt;strong&gt;with bias&lt;/strong&gt; by the arguments &lt;a href=&#34;#User::Maintainer&#34;&gt;maintainers&lt;/a&gt; themselves since their role is to improve
discussion pertaining to their argument, not the question being answered. Comments are informal, so they can only be from proponents
of said argument. This should reduce the number of bad actors as proponents have to upvote the argument itself. The maintainers
are there to clean up remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;userauthor&#34; &gt;User::Author
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#userauthor&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A user that started the argument. They have the power to delete the argument if there
are less than 3 proponents of the argument. All authors are considered a maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;usermaintainer&#34; &gt;User::Maintainer
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#usermaintainer&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A maintainer is a user who has the ability to edit. Authors are considered maintainers but
not vice versa. To make a user a maintainer of an argument requires 75% of maintainers to vote.
There can only be up to 10 maintainers including the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments should have a change history so even if a &lt;a href=&#34;#User::Maintainer&#34;&gt;maintainer&lt;/a&gt; goes rogue, damage should be easily reversible.
If all maintainers go rogue, the author can request operator intervention to kick out the rogue maintainers. Or if the author goes rogue, the maintainers can request an operator intervention. This is where operator neutrality becomes important although not required since arguments can be &amp;ldquo;forked&amp;rdquo;, and the rogue argument basically left to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;question&#34; &gt;Question
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#question&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question can also be referred to as a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can ask subjective questions about topics, but questions that spark debate should be prioritized. Think &amp;ldquo;what is &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; good ice cream flavor&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;what is the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; ice cream flavor&amp;rdquo;. There is a difference, the former seeks to get a good sample, but the latter seeks to find the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question is a duplicate if it conveys the same message or is equal ignoring case and non-grammatic symbols. If it is the latter,
the question can be disallowed from creation, but the former should be marked as duplicate. Duplicate questions should be searchable but not prioritized. A question marked as a duplicate should allow the question creator to argue that the question was incorrectly marked as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Censorship considerations&lt;/summary&gt;
Many times on Stackoverflow, questions are marked as duplicate incorrectly on Stackoverflow where as actual duplicates fly by the radar.
These questions are not technical at all, only discussion prompts, so it is imperative to not censor valid questions.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;merge-request&#34; &gt;Merge Request

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A merge request is a request by a user to add a point or rebuttal to an argument. Merge requests can only be
merged be maintainers and should support informal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reason-or-point&#34; &gt;Reason or Point
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reason-or-point&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single reason that supports the arguments thesis. A point can have upvotes but every
edit or deletion resets the upvote to 0 and thus removes proponents of the argument.
An argument&amp;rsquo;s star count is equal to the sum of upvotes of its reasons which is also the number of proponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A user is considered a proponent of an argument if they&amp;rsquo;ve upvoted a reason of the argument or are a maintainer for an argument.
Only reasoning points of the argument can be upvoted and a user is no longer a proponent if the point they upvoted
gets modified or deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A platform would be created by an operator. The operator has to make a legally bound contract
with all participants that stipulates that the operator will not manipulate or censor civil arguments and should also provide
visitors and a link to download the platform source code (any license allowed). This holds the operator accountable for abuse.
Abuse would either be easily detectable or non-harmful to the goal of figuring out the best arguments. Platforms
can compete with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an operator deleted a comment, an argument, an arguments points, it is pretty noticeable and easy to prove using archive websites.
Vote inflating is possible, but that is why the operator needs to show the UI in terms of rebuttals. Operators that can be shown
to not follow the specs mentioned in this article won&amp;rsquo;t be considered an open-debate platform. If required, I can test out
a platform and classify or declassify it as an open-debate platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to implement this, but I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this here for someone to pursue. My goal with this is to improve unity and reduce polarizations. We need to stop with the harassment of people that hold an opinion. An opinion is much different from
an action and we need to make that distinction by showing our tolerance for opposing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people who think it&amp;rsquo;s okay for the tolerant to be intolerant of the intolerant but that&amp;rsquo;s contradictory. The best way
to debate against someone who promotes intolerance is to tell them that they are only able to promote intolerance because of the tolerant society. If society operated as it did in the past where tolerance is just the intolerance of the majority, then have have learned nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
