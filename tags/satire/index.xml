      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I saw the sign for &amp;ldquo;Dog Food Eating Convention,&amp;rdquo; curiosity drew me in. As a human who takes pleasure from human food, I was interested in why someone would enjoy eating dog food. The scene inside was immediately striking, punctuated by banners and booths proclaiming bizarre devotion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I loooove dogfood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dogfood is amazing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dogfood makes us a better human&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dogfood makes life easier&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like the smell of dog food.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#backstory&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came up with this satirical story while talking to my dad on the phone two months ago in March. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the conversation was specifically about, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely related to echo chambers and how it feels to be an outsider entering one. It&amp;rsquo;s straight up hard to grasp the perspective of those in an echo chamber, because the people in them are so used to &amp;ldquo;persuading&amp;rdquo; their own (i.e. preaching to the choir) instead of talking to people outside of the echo chamber. This is how we end up in a situation like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1k5npba/comment/mojtq1a/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button&#34;&gt;following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing prices rose at the literal exact same rate as a percentage under Harper as they did under Trudeau. Any expert I’ve talked to has told me this has been a multi-decade issue that has been steadily getting worse, and again, the data shows it’s been getting consistently worse at the SAME RATE PRE &amp;amp; POST TRUDEAU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas if we track affordable housing using WHAM, we can see something that shows how absolutely incorrect this comment was in a REAL ESTATE forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e775a21-6b60-4960-a62c-38be0916e1af_930x649.png&#34; alt=&#34;Perspective on housing affordability&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention to the maroon line, you can see how stable and flat it was until 2016, coinciding with a change in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc708eddc-ea67-4c1f-a8de-5e5273382ae4_1060x756.png&#34; alt=&#34;Single-Family Hme Prices Measured in Provincial Median Wages&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also shows that certain cities have only gotten worse since Trudeau. Cities like London were once known to be affordable but are now stupidly expensive; the WHAM for London went from ~110 in 2015 to ~240 in 2024!. That&amp;rsquo;s more than double in terms of worsening affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
