      <title>Gold vs S&amp;P500 Annualized Return by Month Invested (Jan 1975 - Sep 2025)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gold crossed $4,000 per troy ounce on October 7th. Given this milestone, I wanted to investigate the claim that gold is a better investment than the S&amp;amp;P500. When people usually share their charts showing Gold versus the S&amp;amp;P500 &lt;em&gt;index&lt;/em&gt;, there are a few biases I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed. Of course, the same day I started doing my analysis on this topic, CNBC puts out an article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/gold-vs-sp500-returns.html&#34;&gt;gold vs. sp500 long term returns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most egregious bias in my opinion, is the investment year is cherry-picked (e.g. peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000), and along it comparing against NASDAQ instead of the S&amp;amp;P500. To account for this bias, I have charted the difference in returns for all years, and annualized them to make teh results more digestible, since total returns aren&amp;rsquo;t comparable across years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another bias is that people will cherry pick years very long ago without accounting for executive order 6102 which prohibited owning gold from 1933 until the &amp;ldquo;International Development Association Appropriations Act of 1975&amp;rdquo; was passed, legalizing owning gold starting from January 1st, 1975. This bias is accounted for by restricting the time frame from January 1st, 1975 to the most recent data available for comparison (September 1st, 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third bias is comparing against the S&amp;amp;P500 index rather than teh S&amp;amp;P500 total return index which incorporates dividends reinvested. Big shout out to Robert Shiller for maintaining this dataset for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End date: Sep-2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_vs_sp500_plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, since 1975, the S&amp;amp;P 500 manages to outperform gold on a y/y basis 70% of the time (note that this is based on investing at the start of the year). The cool thing about gold is that it has a Beta coefficient of around 0.5 (Yahoo, using GLD ETF as a proxy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the initial plots which show the performance for the two different types of investments, I noticed that since 1997 to the present day (include the monster returns of 2024 and 2025), there are periods where an investment in gold - a zero-cashflow generating asset - would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed the S&amp;amp;P500 - cash flow generating securities. After that there are periods where an investment in the S&amp;amp;P500 would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed gold. This makes some sense once you factor in that gold is not correlated to S&amp;amp;P500. Once the market crashed and started going up in March 2009, due to the great financial crisis, there was opportunity to shift from gold into the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use a 10-year window, the results are bit more different, suggesting that over the long-term the S&amp;amp;P500 will outperform gold. The periods where the S&amp;amp;P500 outperforms are taller and the dot-com bursts are deeper compared to the all time annualized performance, however even on a 10 year period the pre-1995 bull market provided excess returns over gold as well as the post-GFC bull market. These make it very clear that gold is not a buy always hold forever instrument but rather an instrument to bring into play when investors speculate that the risk-free real interest rates is lower than what they desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_10yr_rolling.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price 10 year window&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely a year (2012) where you should&amp;rsquo;ve sold gold for bonds or stocks. The year is 2012 and inflation starts dipping below 2%. The Feds start cutting rates, however its clear that holding USD will provide a provide a positive enough risk-free real rate of return. So what happens to gold? It falls to its &amp;ldquo;fair value&amp;rdquo; and stays there since inflation is being tamed, as made clear with interest rates rising from 2016 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_sp500_ratio_plot_35_years.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Performance&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions that arise after looking at the graphs are why is gold going up in 2024 and 2025, whether this is similar to 2012, how to avoid another dot-com bubble situation, and lastly, how do we know when the top is in regarding the business/debt cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the provided charts, the gold price rise seems to be a reflection of both the  &lt;strong&gt;declining confidence&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s ability to control inflation as well as its status as a safe haven asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is inversely correlated with the expected risk-free real interest rate. Gold is also seen as a safe-haven asset. Meaning that the real interest rate could be flat, but the existence of some fear, like tariffs, could cause mass buying of gold. What factors determine the expected risk-free real interest rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expected inflation rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2025/08/20/us-budget-deficit-forecast-us1-trillion-higher-over-next-decade-watchdog-says/&#34;&gt;increase in deficit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tariffs (import prices are higher)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury Yields (1yr or 10yr)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Feds Fund rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/treasury-yields-and-gold-prices-breaking-expectations&#34;&gt;Treasury yields and gold prices: breaking expectations (March 25, 2025)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the inflation data, the 1yr treasury bill yields, and the actual Feds Fund rates, a relationship can somewhat be determined between expected inflation, expected risk-free real interest rates, and thus gold prices. When the expected risk-free real interest rate falls, gold is viewed as the stronger store of value. This seems to be because treasuries get crowded out due to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/10/staff-analytical-note-2025-25/#Money-market-mutual-funds-have-experienced-high-growth&#34;&gt;lag&lt;/a&gt; in people pulling money out of money market funds as interest rates get cut. The lag is 1yr.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept of real interest rates comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bu-473-investment-management#interest-rates-and-inflation-rates&#34;&gt;Fisher equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_e=N(1-t)-\pi_e&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;real risk-free required rate of return&amp;rdquo; varies by investor type. This is possibly due to differences in taxation. If all participants seek similar post-tax real rates of return, then where they are situated may affect how the bid on securities, and if the market is small enough, it may crowd out investors with higher marginal tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Tax Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions based in zero-tax jurisdictions could drive down pre-tax real returns for all market participants to match their own post-tax expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commodity Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;: institutions are less likely to be able to crowd out commodities like gold, thus it gives all investors ane better chance at pursuing investments that meet their desired risk-free real rates of return when treasury bills don&amp;rsquo;t meet the bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Outlook&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price Ratio over the last 30 years, a gold price crash appears unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Valuation&lt;/strong&gt; (Chart 2): The TR CAPE excess yield metric suggests the S&amp;amp;P 500 is not currently in a speculative bubble. This metric compares the yield of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio against the inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TR CAPE excess yield metric is the difference between the yield of the SP500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio minus the 10-year Treasury yield adjusted for inflation. The implication is that when treasuries offer a better real return than the market, the market is definitely in a bubble since it would be be poised to underperform treasuries on a real basis for the next 10 years. That or it would require a long-term sustaining bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPE takes into account the business cycle and TR takes into account the various method of returning cash to shareholders (dividends, buybacks, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;systemic-crashes&#34; &gt;Systemic Crashes
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#systemic-crashes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market crashing is systemic. There are multiple factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Cycles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a business cycle is going down, it is called a recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment ratios will go up and down just due to the nature of a business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business cycle is what central banks are tasked at shortening, however it is not a solved problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally I think recessions are characterized based on the employment data because unemployment is the problem, not a fall in economic growth. If economic growth exists and people are unemployed, then there is still a crisis because people are struggling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless, a traditional GDP based recession metric is clearly a follow up on a decrease in employment, where the recession becomes a reality if the loss in jobs is long-enough to cause a decrease in consumption, which would result in a decrease in earnings, which decreases stock prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt crisis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recession becomes a debt crisis when a lot of capital is tied to &amp;ldquo;never ending growth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debt crisis occurs when a lot of capital is tied to being owed money from over-leveraged entities who can go under due to even the smallest of mishaps. In the GFC, the subprime mortgage instrument combined with over-leverage meant that a minor real estate correction would wipe out the Lehman Brothers, and of course a fall in employment is going to prevent real estate from continuing to go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black swan events (e.g. lockdowns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in the possibility of a black swan event (e.g. COVID-19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharp rise in interest rates causing valuations to plummet due to a higher required rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, interest rates stopped rising. This in turn started a bull market due to risk-premiums being fixed. As interest rates were hiked in 2022, the market risk-premium necessitates that the required rate of return is higher. When the required rate of return rises without the stock market already having corrected, a rise in the required rate of return (based on expectations not just rate announcements), would immediately cause downward pressure on stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34; &gt;Looking Forward
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#looking-forward&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to pursue live graphs that show a simple risk factor as to how likely forward earnings will miss expectations (and thus cause a systemic crash) barring external and black swan events. On top of that, because systemic crashes cause even good stocks to go down, there needs to be a super simple tool that can figure out which stocks were oversold. In a market crash, one of the reasons for asset sales is the lack of liquidity itself! Stock valuations aren&amp;rsquo;t just a reflection of fundamentals but also of liquidity (supply &amp;amp; demand). Some factors that are interesting to me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation (to predict interest rate announcements, however bank analysts will probably do this themselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jobs data (to predict and visualize where the economy is in the business cycle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-free interest rates (to know what the market&amp;rsquo;s required rate of return is)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the required rate of return is a combination of Beta, equity-risk premium, and the risk-free return. The equity risk-premium is not necessarily static, however it must be a positive number. My theory is that it depends on the various opportunity costs available at any point in time. As time goes forward and as investment innovations increase, equity-risk premiums should be rising, however they can fluctuate due to government policies providing or removing incentives for certain industries and sectors. We must also be aware that the equity risk premium is affected by investable wealth. Meaning that the larger the security in terms of market capitalization, the lower the equity risk premium is to compensate for the fact that more capital to invest also means less available investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year treasury prices and yield versus gold (specifically for analyzing periods of distress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several prominent economists have warned about speculative bubbles and irrational market behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/strong&gt; (December 5, 1996, &amp;ldquo;The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets&amp;hellip; But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Franco Modigliani&lt;/strong&gt;, Nobel Laureate (March 30, 2000, New York Times):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The expectation of growth produces the growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up. But once you are convinced that it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Irrational exuberance is the psychological basis of a speculative bubble&amp;hellip; news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person&amp;hellip; bringing in a larger and larger class of investors who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly by envy of others&amp;rsquo; successes and partly through a gamblers&amp;rsquo; excitement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Away From Stock Picking</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/moving-away-from-stock-picking/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 22:48:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/moving-away-from-stock-picking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a look at my portfolio&amp;rsquo;s benchmark today, $&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf&#34;&gt;DISV&lt;/a&gt;, and it confirmed a conclusion I had come to earlier in the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the capital to call yourself a hedge fund manager and hire some analysts, you&amp;rsquo;re better off building an international portfolio that isn&amp;rsquo;t concentrated around large-cap US companies. Seeking alpha in the stock market is for hobbyists, not investors with a preference for investing passively! Alpha is the excess return between a portfolio and its benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-to-stock-picking-and-sp500&#34; &gt;Alternative to Stock Picking and SP500
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-to-stock-picking-and-sp500&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least three biases that exist in the status quo investment advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US dominance (regarding VOO, ZSP.TO),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favouritsm given to 100 (NASDAQ 100) / 500 &lt;strong&gt;US-listed large-cap&lt;/strong&gt; stocks over 5,000+ global stocks (1,500 small-cap value, 3800 core equity) (regarding QQQ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-cap weighted holdings even though market cap is not correlated to future returns and may increase portfolio risk instead of decreasing portfolio risk (regarding RSP, VEQT.TO, EQL.TO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To correct for these biases, without picking individual stocks, a well thought out portfolio made up solely of ETFs, would look something like the below. This is what I would recommend to everyone, at least as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not mainstream. I plan on investing exclusively in DISV and VSUX exclusively since my portfolio already has a lot of US and Canadian equity exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International ex-USA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (35%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VSUX (30%)
Index ETF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA (25% of the global economy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$AVUV (15%): US small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$EQL.TO / $RSP (10%): US equal-weighted SP500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discretionary (10%)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either stock picking or one of the ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market/#converting-cad-to-usd-and-back-norberts-gambit&#34;&gt;Norbert&amp;rsquo;s gambit&lt;/a&gt; to buy the US-listed ETFs, then I recommend to just buy VEQT.TO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can adjust this mix to max out at 90%, leaving you with 10% for discretionary investing. US investors can just ignore the 10% domestic allocation and use it for discretionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-portfolio&#34; &gt;My Portfolio
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#my-portfolio&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of research these past few weeks hunting for small-cap value stocks and mid-cap growth stocks and although I&amp;rsquo;ve started building positions in the stocks I believe will outperform my benchmark (GOOGL), I have decided that this will be the last time I do such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you only need 20 stocks to reduce your portfolio risk to something close to systemic/market risk. The problem though is that you will miss out on stocks if you aren&amp;rsquo;t constantly revaluating your current picks and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I use GOOGL as my benchmark for &lt;em&gt;picking stocks&lt;/em&gt;, my portfolio&amp;rsquo;s benchmark is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (60%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VXUS (40%): core equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;m done building up my portfolio and buying the discretionary stocks on my &lt;em&gt;Buy list&lt;/em&gt;, future deposits will be invested in DISV and VXUS. I value my time and these ETFs can definitely save mine while meeting my investment preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those new to investing, feel free to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/investing/&#34;&gt;How to Invest in the Stock Market as a Canadian&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dollar-cost-averaging&#34; &gt;Dollar Cost Averaging
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dollar-cost-averaging&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to not pick stocks is that when you go to invariably dollar cost average via a portfolio rebalance, you are trying to time the market and you can end up getting burned. It&amp;rsquo;s much better to take it easy for at least 3 months before you dollar cost average for the first time. Unless it&amp;rsquo;s a profitable sub 20 P/E large cap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is not a long-term BUY</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lululemon-is-not-a-long/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 15:30:37 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lululemon-is-not-a-long/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025-06: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a position in LULU, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also placed a limit sell order at ~$385.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally came to this conclusion in September (12th), but it was sitting in my pinned Google Keep for months. The recent sky rocketing of LULU is just another piece of evidence that the market is irrational. The stock was bleeding for months when I decided it might be time to buy but my investing philosophy at the time was &amp;ldquo;is it possible to regret my purchase in 10 years.&amp;rdquo; When I invest in stocks, I value peace of mind over maximizing profits. Of course, one way to do that is to invest for a specific time horizon. The other way, which I am going to start implementing is to do the work to arrive at a sell price. That was the strategy to use when it comes to LULU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compelling reason that existed to buy LULU is because I thought the Chinese will buy their apparel when their economy recovers (I was proven right as the stock skyrocketed recently on International sales). Even so, I still needed a sell price. And that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible for me to arrive at the short-term fair price, so heuristics will need to be used (for future stock considerations). Two heuristics I employ are industry P/E (many issues with P/E) or &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.koyfin.com/share/e31aae25cd&#34;&gt;historic cashflow yield standard deviations&lt;/a&gt; as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/stocks/koyfin_lulu_20241208_040544132.webp&#34; alt=&#34;LULU Cash Flow Yield&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase LULU in September is because &lt;strong&gt;this is not a buy and hold stock&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you go on Instagram, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly realize that LULU does not actually have a moat and many relatively unknown and yet sizable brands, are also using influencer marketing such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/keepthatpump/&#34;&gt;KeepThatPump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dfyne.official/&#34;&gt;dfyne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/whitefoxboutique/&#34;&gt;White Fox Boutique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates market saturation and is a red flag to me. This is also why I never bought and do not recommended stocks like Celsius. The good thing about all this research though is that I have a list of luxe-like retailers for the purpose of buying gifts. These companies could make a lot of money if they also started targeting ads at men in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So investing in retail stocks would usually require very high insight into the market so that you can quickly respond to trends. Sorry, that&amp;rsquo;s not me, but the investment funds that manage billions of dollars in assets could easily pay someone to keep track of these trends for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailer stocks include but are not limited to LULU, ANF, CROX, BBW. The problem I have with these stocks isn&amp;rsquo;t their valuation. They could be undervalued, I&amp;rsquo;m just saying that these stocks are better valued by actual professional analysts who have more market trend information on their hand than individual investors who can only really buy using &lt;strong&gt;anecdotal, financial, and/or macro analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Micro-economics is an advantage for being an investment banking analyst, but when it&amp;rsquo;s not a full time job, you need to be aware of [your] bounded rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why DigitalOcean (DOCN) is not a Buy</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 18:35:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/digitalocean-is-not-a-buy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it time for me to sell &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOCN/&#34;&gt;$DOCN&lt;/a&gt;? A perspective from a fan and hopefully soon to be ex-shareholder. This is not a bearish take, just a value-portfolio analysis perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34; &gt;Summary
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like DOCN as a company, however I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it&amp;rsquo;s own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34; &gt;What I Used to Think about DOCN
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-used-to-think-about-docn&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of ~20 &amp;ldquo;undervalued&amp;rdquo; stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I&amp;rsquo;m up 11% which is better than my benchmark &lt;a href=&#34;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MORT/&#34;&gt;$MORT&lt;/a&gt; which has returned 7% during this time. MORT is my benchmark because I was expecting interest rates to be cut and so I expected this ETF to appreciate in value once that happened while paying out* higher than the overnight federal funds rate / risk-free in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-competitive-analysis&#34; &gt;Business-Competitive Analysis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#business-competitive-analysis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they&amp;rsquo;ve done incorrectly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how nice their products are, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how cost effective they are&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don&amp;rsquo;t even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.serverhunter.com&#34;&gt;serverhunter.com&lt;/a&gt;) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. live streaming which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use &amp;ldquo;competitive advantage&amp;rdquo; as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: apparently DigitalOcean VPS&amp;rsquo;s are trash when it comes to performance compared to OvhCloud and Vultr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;P/E is over 60, Beta over 1.5, QoQ growth has been 2-4% last 3 quarters. FCF market cap yield is 3% compared to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% at Google (which is a mature &amp;amp; profitable company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-wrong-with-current-etfs&#34; &gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong with Current ETFs?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-wrong-with-current-etfs&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with Cybersecurity ETFs is that most (except for IHAK) are market-cap weighted. This is bad because it assumes that the probability of financial success is higher for large cap compared to small cap cybersecurity firms. This is wrong for two reasons. The first reason is that the cybersecurity market is rising year over year so all firms are poised to grow profits. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just theory. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen similar percentage year-over-year revenue growth between small (e.g. SentinelOne) and large (e.g. CrowdStrike) cybersecurity firms! If growth is the same, why hold more of the larger firm in our portfolios/ETFs? The second reason is that these small firms do in fact have competitive advantages and aren&amp;rsquo;t just new entrants trying to make a quick buck by taking advantage of the rise in demand of cybersecurity (in response to the rise in significant attacks). I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt those companies exist, however it looks like the firms that pivot are more likely to fall into this category, and so we will label these as Tier 2 cybersecurity companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;etf-proposal&#34; &gt;ETF Proposal
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#etf-proposal&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My proposal is to categorize companies into two tiers. Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 is pure-play cybersecurity companies or companies where cybersecurity revenue is the majority of the revenue mix. Tier 2 companies consist of firms that offer security but are not known or do not depend on that revenue. The rationale for Tier 2 is that it&amp;rsquo;s significantly more difficult to judge how important the cybersecurity segment is to these companies as well as being able to retrieve division financial stats on demand. In contrast, for pure-play firms, we can just go to Yahoo Finance. For Tier 2 companies, we&amp;rsquo;d have to read their 10K annual report. Sure an ETF provider can easily do this, but there&amp;rsquo;s an assumption that the cybersecurity division is a reported segment to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tier 2 companies should have half the weight of the tier 1 companies. We could even argue that there should be a tier 3, however, that requires some more effort in differentiating and sorting. Note that this list is not periodically updated, so compare to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/bug/&#34;&gt;BUG Cybersecurity ETF from Global X&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll add a changelog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Changelog&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 19th, 2025: Added A10 Networks Inc, AhnLab Inc, Onespan Inc, Digital Arts Inc, Rapid7 Inc, Telos Corporation, Hennge KK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 23rd, 2025: Removed SecureWorks (acquired by Sophos for a 28% premium)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate weight, do the following. Calculate the denominator as follows: (T2 stocks + 2x T1 stocks). For T2 stocks, the weight is 1/D. For T1 stocks, the weight is 2/D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/literary-analysis/thinking-fast-and-slow-daniel-kahneman&#34;&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testable cases: Enron (2), Seagram, Risk Profiling, Shattered Sears&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshmallow study: children taking one marshmallow now or waiting five minutes to get two. Study flawed because it only focused on stanford kids (affluence) and wasn&amp;rsquo;t transferable when looking at kids who are less affluent. Ability to postpone gratification at an early age led to more successful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We seek to maximize our consumption utility. Imperfect measurements. Tradeoff is cost ($ and time). Rational. Self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospect theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people make decisions based on how they &lt;strong&gt;perceive&lt;/strong&gt; trade-offs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceive: humane element; emotional, rational, instincts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: what is the mind behind a collector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss aversion&lt;/strong&gt;: fear losses more than gains
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gains have to significantly outweigh the losses to incentivize humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments have to be marketed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive limitations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People making weird decisions because they are ignorant&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bounded to your knowledge and experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;often in the case of investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not daily job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mortgage timelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we personally evaluate risk, rewards, preferences, and utility. Bias: emotional and cognitive bias. Requires high self-regulation, self-reflection, and humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision Making Process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer behaviour and investment behaviour is similar for people without training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need better frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros vs Cons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impulse, lack of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional finance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rational assumption: people still not doing things good for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient at obtaining the right information: is the information really readily accessible and do they know it&amp;rsquo;s relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unbiased&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires discreteness, indifference curves, transitivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indifference curve optimally is the biggest slope tangent to the curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayes Theorem
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(expected given I)  = P(E) * P(I given E) / P(I)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classification models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confident, impetuous, careful, anxious, methodical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adventurer: Investors who are confident as well as make impulsive decisions have been classified as the adventurer in the BBK model. These are the kinds of investors who will make very risky investments. They are often seen investing in the futures and options space with high amounts of leverage. Often, they put all of their money on one single bet based on the level of confidence they might have on that bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the advisor’s point of view, such investors can be difficult to give advice to. This is because they have their own ideas about investing and are not afraid to test them in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Celebrities: These investors are also known for making impulsive decisions. However, instead of being confident, they are known for being anxious. This is the worst combination of traits amongst the four quadrants! The celebrities are not confident. Hence, they do not have their own investment theories. This means that they are gullible and are often taken advantage of by middlemen who want them to trade excessively so that they can earn commissions in the process. As an ethical advisor, one may have to make emotional appeals to this type of investor since they often do not respond to rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Individualists: This category of investors is both confident as well as methodical. These types of investors have their own investment philosophy. They tend to know something about the market or at least make an attempt to learn before they invest their hard-earned money. Also, since they are very rational and analytical, they tend to come to the right conclusion. This is the best combination of traits in the four quadrants. Such investors are closest to the textbook rational investors. However, it needs to be noted that very few investors actually fall in this category. These are the best possible clients for an investment advisor since it is possible to make rational arguments and convince these investors. If it makes sense, then convincing these investors will be easy. If they are made aware of their behavioral biases, they are most likely to correct their course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian: The guardians are anxious as well as careful at the same time. This category of investors generally comprises of old people who are nearing retirement. These people tend to be quite methodical when it comes to decision making. However, they are also quite anxious about the safety of the money that they invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardians are generally people who have a limited earning capability. Hence, they are more likely to preserve the assets that they have instead of taking risks. Guardians are generally not interested in volatile investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an investment advisor, they can be difficult to advise since they are also partly driven by the emotion of fear. If these clients get a feeling that the advisor is overbearing, they are most likely to change the advisors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Straight Arrow: The four main quadrants are already described above. However, the BBK model has been extended to include a fifth category. This category is represented in the center, i.e., the interaction of the two axes. They are called the straight arrows. This is where a lot of investors tend to fall. These investors are known to have a composite of all the four traits and hence are known to be fairly balanced. Oftentimes, they are called the average investor since most investors a person comes across are likely to fall in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, overconfident CEOs who overestimate future firm performance are more likely to provide positive information to analysts, thus increasing the likelihood of analysts issuing optimistic earnings forecasts for firms with over- confident CEOs. Second, overconfident CEOs may overestimate the precision of their information and disclose more precise information, which in turn may result in less dispersed analyst forecasts. Finally, managers who exhibit over- confidence show an increased willingness to voluntarily disclose information through management earnings guidance, which may lead to smaller forecast errors relative to managers who are less willing to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding onto options that are in the money is considered over-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% more optimistic analyst forecasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.4% to 4.3% smaller forecast errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% to 3.8% smaller forecast deviations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;market forecasters are egregiously overconfident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;success, measured by correct prediction leads to increased overconfidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market experience, which is symptomatic of past success, is associated with higher levels of overconfidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market learns to be overconfident through past collective success&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lithium Americas Valuation (LAC)</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lithium-americas-valuation/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/lithium-americas-valuation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is a mining corporation focused on extracting sedimentary lithium from &lt;a href=&#34;https://lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/overview/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Thacker Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;The largest known &lt;strong&gt;Measured&lt;/strong&gt; and Indicated Resource in North America.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lithiumamericas.com/investor/overview/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;TSX:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nyse.com/quote/LAC&#34;&gt;NYSE:LAC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: $ is in the USD denomination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Lithium Americas announced a share issuance of 55,000,000 shares for a total of 250,000,000 ($5/share). The first part values the company using efficient market hypothesis. The second part is a quasi-dividend discount model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Efficient Market Hypothesis
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#valuing-based-on-efficient-market-hypothesis&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair price of $4.97. Upside of 30 cents of 8% on top of required rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Before Announcement = $6.66
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding before = 162.16M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Market Cap Before = $6.66 * 162.16 = 1,080M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares added = 55M
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shares outstanding present = 217.16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Ceteris Paribus = $4.97
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upside 0.37 cents per share or 8% based on recent after close pricing.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commentary: This is more of a question on whether the market will figure out that LAC is trading at a discount. I remember when PBR dropped 11%+ and it came back up for the dividend. I sold it before the CEO was replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34; &gt;Valuing Based on Future Dividend Distributions
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#valuing-based-on-future-dividend-distributions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithium Americas is fairly valued at [4.43, 4.9] using conservative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough valuation was done using conservative assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;192.9 Mega ton of proven reserves equivalent to 3.3 mega tons of Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price per ton: US $5,400
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the Thacker Pass is operational, selling at a price higher than this lower bound will draw returns over 10% on the investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful life: 40 years
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although production will be smaller in the earlier years and double in the later years, we will assume a smoothened annuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mining net profit margin = 7%
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net profit margins vary between the years and can be as high as 20% or as low as -7%. Better to pick a number that makes sense in the long-term. 7% could be an over-estimate, but if mining corporations were known to have low net profit margins, the market would be valuing it a significantly less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount rate of 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Annuity = 3.3 * 1000000 * 5400 * 0.07 / 40 = $31,185,000 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the annuity formula, we get a present value of 304,959,697. The PV is a year before the plant becomes operational. We will assume 2025, but the longer it takes, the longer we will under-perform the  market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add back Net Tangible Assets of 407,462,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus the Cash infusion of $250,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair Value = 712,421,697 + 250,000,000
= 962,421,697&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided by shares outstanding of 217.16M and we get US $4.43, which is only 4% less than the last price of $4.60 and 6% less than the last closing price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fair value price at the end of the year is higher than the current price, the current price is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommendation&#34; &gt;Recommendation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommendation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EMH, LAC is a buy. After a valuation, the risk is if Phase 1 will be passed, which is likely given the $250,000,000 cash infusion. Since the stock is valued fairly using safe assumptions, LAC is a buy for risk-seekers. For the risk-averse, fair-value without profits can never be a buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Novel Investment Portfolio Strategies</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/novel-investment-portfolio-strategies/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:36:16 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/novel-investment-portfolio-strategies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is about active management, although a more important question to answer is &lt;strong&gt;how to find&lt;/strong&gt; stocks that have the opportunity to generate alpha. For Passive ETF Investing, read &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/how-to-invest-in-the-stock-market#passive-etf-Investing&#34;&gt;How to invest in the stock market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about portfolio weighting, there&amp;rsquo;s usually only three that people are taught: market capitalization, price, equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is ideal? We know price is not ideal because it&amp;rsquo;s based on the share price which is determined by the shares outstanding. With market price and equal weight, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit harder. Usually equal weight is better, but clearly, the top stocks (tech) of the S&amp;amp;P500 has made the market weighted index outperform the equal weighted index. Therefore, we need an equal weighted portfolio where the weight of the heavy weights are bigger than if they were in the SP500 market-weighted index. We need a way to trim the world stock market into just a few stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick 20-25 stocks across industries to reduce risk to systemic levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since mid-cap outperforms large cap and small-cap is high risk, make sure that the basket is something like 80% mid-caps, 10% large-caps, 10% small cap ETF (invest in all small caps or pick no more than 2-3 that are definitely undervalued)&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;Large&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= $20B; &amp;lt; $100B&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Mega&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= $100B&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2-3 (~10%)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rough estimate on the allocations, however, I think my own portfolio is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to maximize returns is to focus on Mature-Growth and Value stocks and speculating on growth stocks. A growth stock is a company that is losing money but is growing at 10%+ yoy in revenues. A Mature-Growth is similar but is profitable (i.e. profit grows). A Mature company does not grow profits; usually pays dividends. A Value is company is any one of these (not growth), which in fundamentally undervalued in the most likely scenario of &amp;ldquo;business as usual.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that write down the assumptions of the market that the stock price reflects, ask yourself if those assumptions are wrong in a favourable manner, and if so, that is a value stock. An example is PayPal. PayPal is priced to die in 20 years. PayPal has been alive for 20 years during which time even crypto did not replace PayPal. PayPal is not just a payment provider but also a processor (Stripe is just a processor). Therefore, PayPal has value beyond 20 years of being a payment method.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weights are (1 - market-cap weight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy: smaller &lt;strong&gt;mid-cap&lt;/strong&gt; stocks have more growth potential (and thus higher returns when in a basket) than larger companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not re-balance until new stocks are added, and even then re-balance from largest-cap and overweight to the new stock. Never profit take since the strategy relies on betting on the small ones which will keep winning until they are big enough to take profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy A: pick stocks based on positive-driven Beta for stocks that are recessionary proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy B: pick stocks based on Beta&amp;rsquo;s with time horizons that are more in line with investment time horizons (include recency bias if doing en-masse). Then, you take advantage of stocks that report higher Beta&amp;rsquo;s than what you calculated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derivative: financial instruments that depend on an underlying asset. Everything in finance could be considered a derivative.
In finance, there is no wealth generation, only wealth redistribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Changing nature of a liability
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed rate loan and you want to change that into a variable one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can either pay back the loan and take a variable rate (transaction costs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you can use a derivate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the nature of an investment without incurring the costs of selling one portfolio and buying another

&lt;li&gt;Agreement to buy or sell underlying asset at some point in the future for a certain price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spot contract is buying or selling immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example. Spot price of $100, risk-free of 5%, Expected price in a year is $110. F0 is 105 if there is no risk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling = short position. Buying = long position&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When used for hedging, profits are not recorded for accounting purposes until the contract is closed (pg. 59). If not for hedging, then the books would note the gain/loss in the year end even if the contract will not be closed until the next year&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Margin is cash or marketable securities deposited by an investor with his or her broker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The balance in the margin account is adjusted to reflect daily settlement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin minimizes the possibility of a loss through a default on a contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail traders provide &lt;strong&gt;initial margin&lt;/strong&gt; and, when the balance in the margin account falls below a &lt;strong&gt;maintenance margin level&lt;/strong&gt;, they must provide variation margin bringing balance back up to initial margin level.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Long hedge is when you know you will lock in the price for an asset you know you will buy in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short hedge is when you know you will sell an asset in the future and want to lock in the price&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;$5MM portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 Beta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One contract is $250 times the index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 * 5,000,000 / 250,000 = 30 contracts short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index level of 1,000. Future price of 1,010, 250x per contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio value of $5,050,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-free = 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend = 1% per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beta = 1.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 month horizon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future exit in 4 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.5 \* (5,050,000 / (250 * 1,010)) = 30 contracts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 3 months, index is at 900 and the future is at 902&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the net value?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R = (P1 - P0 + D) / P0 = (P1 - P0) / P0 + D / P0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R = Rf + Beta (Rm - Rf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain from short position = &lt;code&gt;(1010 - 902) * 30 * 250= 810,000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Loss from index = (900 - 1000 + 1% * 1000 / 12 * 4) / 1000 = -97.5 / 1000 = -9.75%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rp = 4% / 4+ 1.5 (-0.0975 - 0.04 / 4) = -15.125%&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice that we divided risk free rate to account for 3 month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vp = 5,050,000 (1 - 15.125%) + 810,000 = 5,096,187.50&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Treasury rate is artificially low because Banks do not keep capital for Treasury instruments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OIS rates is a proxy for the risk-free rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose that in a U.S. three-month OIS the notional principal is $100 million and the fixed rate (i.e., the OIS rate) is 3% per annum. If the geometric average of overnight effective federal funds rates during the three months proves to be 2.8% per annum, the fixed rate payer has to pay 0.25 × (0.030 − 0.028) × $100,000,000 or $50,000 to the floating rate payer. (This calculation does not take account of the impact of day count conventions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One person pays a fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the person paying a fixed rate (and receiving a floating rate) the credit risk is
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The floating rate is expected to decrease based on the term structure (upward sloping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates decline unexpectedly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit risk is greater when term structure slopes downward (market expects interest rates to decrease in the long term) and the risk exposure increases when interest rates decline&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OTC agreement that a certain LIBOR rate will apply to a certain principal during a certain future time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predetermined rate RK is exchanged for interest at the LIBOR rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FRA can be valued by assuming the forward LIBOR interest rate RF is certain to be realized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value = Present Value of the difference between the forward LIBOR interest rate (RF) and the interest paid at the FRA rate RK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(RF - RK) * Principal * length of the contract&lt;/code&gt; and then discount to 0 from T2 at the risk free rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case: floating rate payment in the future but you want to make sure you are paying a fixed rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the receiver will want a premium for receiving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company has agreed that it will receive 4% on $100 million for 3 months starting in 3 years. The forward rate for the period between 3 and 3.25 years is 3%. The value of the contract to the company is +$250,000 discounted from time 3.25 years to time zero at the OIS rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(0.04 - 0.03) * 100_000_000 * 0.25 / (1.03^3.25) = 250_000 / (1.03 ^ 3.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose rate proves to be 4.5% (with quarterly compounding). The payoff is –$125,000 at the 3.25 year point. Often the FRA is settled at time 3 years for the present value of the known cash flow at time 3.25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-125_000 / (1 + (0.045 * 0.25)) = -123_609.39&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x6 FRA: starts in 3 months (90 days) and ends in 6 months (180 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6x9 FRA: starts in 6 months (180 days) and ends in 9 months (270 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: rate of 3.10% for 6x9. 3% right now. What is the fixed rate in the agreement?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1 + (0.031 * 0.75)) / (1 + 0.03 * 0.5) = (1 + R * 0.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RF = 3.251%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question: 3 months have passed, and the rate has gone to 3.25% for 3 months and 3.3% for 6 months. what is the value of the FRA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1 + (0.033 * 0.5)) / (1 + 0.0325 * 0.25) = (1 + R * 0.25)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RF = 3.323%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FRA = (0.03323 - 0.03251) * 0.25 / (1 + 0.033 * 0.5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FRA = 0.00017710154273060686 of the loan amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A financial manager needs to hedge against a possible decrease in short-term interest rates. He decides to hedge his risk exposure by going short on a 3X6 FRA that expires in 90 days and is based on a 90-day LIBOR. The current LIBOR spot rates are observed: 30-day 5.83%, 90-day 6.00%, 180-day 6.14% and 360-day 6.51%. What is the rate the manager would receive on this FRA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest paid on $1 for 180 days: 0.0614 * 0.5 = 0.0307&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest paid on $1 for 90 days: 0.06 * 0.25 = 0.015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected interest paid on $1 from 3x6 (compounded from 90-day): (1.0307 / 1.015 - 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected interest rate for 3x6 (compounded from 90): (1.0307 / 1.015 - 1) / 0.25 = 6.19%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all these equations, T is the time till maturity in years from the present. r is the continuous compounding rate for the period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first negotiated, a forward contract is worth 0 because neither party is actually paying for the contract to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later, when there is a contract with delivery price K and a contract with delivery price F0, we can show that the value of the contract is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long forward contract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, a rate of say 8% continuous compounding for 3 month period requires multiplying the rate by the months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each $100 face value of bond,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Price received by short party = most recent settlement price * conversion factor + accrued interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year Treasury note futures contract quotes are to the nearest half of a thirty-second (0.5/32ths). 127-015 means 127 + 1.5/32 and 90-08 means 90 + 8/32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-year and 2-year Treasury note contracts are quoted to nearest quarter of a thirty-second (0.25/32ths). 119-197 means 119 + 19.75 / 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement is priced on a 6% bond and delivery can be any bond with a maturity of more than 15 years but less
than 25 years. The conversion factor is unique to each bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each contract is delivery of $100,000 face value of bonds. Suppose recent settlement price is 90-00, there&amp;rsquo;s a conversion factor of 1.3800, and the accrued interest is $3 per $100 face value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, (1.3800 × 90.00) + 3.00 = $127.20. Since $100,000 face value is delivered (x1000), the total cash received is $127,200.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoted price the bond would have on the first day of delivery month assuming interest rate is 6% with semi-annual compounding and the maturity is rounded down to a multiple of 3 months. If the maturity is not a multiple of 6 months, assume a coupon is paid in three months meaning that accrued interest of 3 months has to be subtracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first example of these rules, consider a 10% coupon bond with 20 years and two months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The first coupon payment is assumed to be made after six months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at six-month intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that the face value is $100. When the discount rate is 6% per annum with semiannual compounding (or 3% per six months), the value of the bond is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sum from i=1 to i=40 { 5/1.03^i } + 100 / 1.03^40 = 146.23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divided by the face value to get a conversion factor of 1.4623&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider an 8% coupon bond with 18 years and 4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments back to a point in time three months from today at 6% per annum (compounded semiannually) gives a value of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 months from today, the value is 4 (for the last coupon?) + sum from i=1 to i=36 {4 / 1.03^i} + 100 / 1.03^36 = 125.83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discounting to today is 125.83 / (1.03^0.5) = 123.99. Subtract the accrued interest of 2 (3/6 * 4) to get 121.99&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;115 quoted bond price, 12% coupon, conversion factor of 1.6, 60 days since last coupon payment, 122 till next coupon payment, 148 after that till contract Maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S0 is the CASH VALUE not the quoted value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S0 = 115 + (60/182) * 6 = 116.978&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I = 6e^(-0.1 * (122/365)) = 5.803&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F0 = (S0 - I)e^(rT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F0 = (116.987 - 5.803)e^(0.1 * (270/360)) = 119.211&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoted F0 = 119.711 - total accrued interest = 119.711 - 148/183 * 6 = 114.851&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we need to divide by the conversion factor to get 71.79&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OTC agreement to exchange cash flows in the future. Calculation usually involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or another market variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You agree to pay a fixed-rate and get paid back a floating rate (e.g. LIBOR or OIS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose Apple has an obligation to pay LIBOR + 0.1%. If they purchase a SWAP with CitiBank, they pay CitiBank a fixed rate, say 3%, and receive LIBOR. Therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s a fixed rate of 3.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can also convert a fixed rate to a floating if they think interest rates will come down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;AAACorp wants to borrow floating (4% fixed, 6-month LIBOR - 0.1% Floating)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pays 120 less in fixed and 70 less in floating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBBCorp wants to borrow fixed (5.2% fixed, 6-month LIBOR + 0.6%)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spread is 70 basis points in floating compared to 120 in basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Swap designed:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefit that needs to be split is: 120 - 70 = 50 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think: one corporation has to pay floating to the other, so calculate the fixed rate paid to each other which is the fixed rate + half the benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBBCorp borrows floating at +0.6% and pays fixed 4.35% and receives floating
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefit = 5.2% - 4.95% = 25 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AAACorp borrows fixed at 4% and pays floating and receives 4.35%
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spread = -0.1% + 0.35% = 25 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a financial institution, there is a cut that is taken. That cut is basically split in two.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Swap
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefit is (2 - 0.4)  = 160 basis points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, GE borrows USD at 5%, pays 8% for AUD and gets 6.2% in USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, Quantas borrows AUD at 8%, pays 6.2% USD, and gets 8% AUD&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;USD interest rates are 2.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% yen, 4% dollars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Principals are $10M and 1,200M yen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap lasts more than 3 years&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series of events where there are two possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock price is currently $20. In three months it will either be $22 or $18. Suppose call option has strike price 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta: shares long for every options shorted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value of the portfolio when short a call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;20 * delta - f&lt;/code&gt; where f is the value of the option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22, &lt;code&gt;22 * delta - 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 18, &lt;code&gt;18 * delta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;22*delta - 1 = 18 * delta&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;delta = 0.25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value in 3 months is 4.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;code&gt;4.5 * e^-( -0.12*0.25) = 4.367&lt;/code&gt; where risk-free rate is 12%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, 20(0.25) - f = 4.367 → f = 0.633&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk less when &lt;code&gt;Delta = (fu - fd) / (S0u - S0d)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f = (pfu + (1 - p)fd)e^(-rT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p = (e^(rt) - d) / (u - d)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;u = the multiplicative factor for an up movement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = the multiplicative factor for a down movement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to solve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find relationship of portfolio to index.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The portfolio return is the value that fell plus the pro-rated dividends that was received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then use this return to calculate the situational return on the index and subtract the dividend yield
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do do this use CAPM formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This nominal value on the index is the strike price we want to purchase of the put&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find number of puts to purchase
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put options to purchase to cover the initial portfolio: &lt;code&gt;Beta \* ValueOfPortfolio / (ValueOfIndex * 100)&lt;/code&gt; where values are the initial values&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Delta = change in option price with relation to underlying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vega or Lambda: change in option price with relation to underlying implied volatility
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if volatility goes up and price of underlying stays the same, both the put and call options go up in price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theta: change in option price with relation to time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If gamma and delta are 0, then the portfolio is risk-neutral and should be appreciating at the risk-free rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rho: change in option price with relation to interest rate&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive for long puts and calls since if price goes up, delta will go up for call obviously, but also up for put since less short is needed in underlying&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we hold a short call position and hold delta shares, why are we doing so? When the underlying&amp;rsquo;s value goes up, we lose delta in the short call options, but we also gain on the underlying shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delta on a european non-dividend call is N(d1)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;european non-dividend put: N(d1) - 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As time to maturity decreases, delta of out the money calls increases, and in the money calls decreases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy high sell low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting in 2000, mortgage originators relaxed lending standards and created large subprime first mortgages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand for real estate and prices rose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% mortgage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teaser rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no income, no job, no assets (NINJAs), ARMs, teaser rates, liar loans, &lt;strong&gt;non-recourse borrowing&lt;/strong&gt; (repossession)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-was-not-accounted-for&#34; &gt;What was not accounted for

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default correlation increase in stressed market conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovery rates are less in stressed market conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tranche with a certain rating cannot be equated with a bond with the same rating
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBB tranches used to create ABS CDOs were 1% wide nad had all or nothing distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not the same as the loss distribution for a BBB bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capital required to keep for the tranches was less than the mortgages themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mortgage originators: only cared about originating mortgages that can be securitized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuers: under pressure to provide high valuations to keep business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traders: focused on year-end bonus and not long term&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CCPs and SEFs for OTC derivatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonuses limited in Europe&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P-E ratio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is should be versus what it is.
Payout ratio over (ke – g).  Or (1- retention ratio) / (ke – g)

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable growth: based on what is retained, times the return on earnings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROE = Earnings / Book Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferred Stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulative means that missed payments are still owed.
With non-cumulative preferred shares, company does not have to pay the missed payments ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares become voting at default payment to preferred shares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOW is &lt;strong&gt;price-weighted&lt;/strong&gt; (not value weighted) and it&amp;rsquo;s divisor accounts for stock-splits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price-weighted is where you take the sum of prices and divided it by a divisor (given)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the return of a price-weighted index is based of the index and not the individual returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A t-bill has a bank discount yield of 6.81% based on the ask price and 6.9% based on the bid price. The maturity of the bill is 60 days. Find the bid and ask prices of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert 6.81% and 6.9% for 60 days. 360 days in a year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1000 - 1000 * 0.0681 * 60 / 360 = 988.65&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1000 - 1000 * 0.069 * 60 / 360 = 988.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore the bid-ask spread is just $0.15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A u.s. treasury bill with 90-day maturity sells at a bank discount yield of 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. what is the price of the bill?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;c. what is the bond-equivalent yield of the bill?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;d. what is the effective annual yield of the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. 1000 - 1000 * 0.03 * 90 / 360 = 992.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. 1000 / 992.5 - 1= 0.756%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. 365 days instead of 360: yield = 0.756% * 365 / 90 = 3.06%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchase 300 shares of GameStart at $40/share. Borrows $4,000 from her broker to
help pay for the purchase. Interest rate on loan is 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. What is the margin of Dei&amp;rsquo;s account when she first purchases the stock?
b. share price falls to $30 per share at year end, what is the remaining margin (equity)
on the account?
c. margin requirement is 30%, will a margin call occur?
d. What is the rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. (300 * 40 - 4,000) / 300 * 40 = (12,000 - 4,000) / 12,000 = 66.7%
b. 30 * 300 - 4,000 * 1.08 = 4,680
c. 4680 / 9000 = 52% &amp;gt; 30%, so no
d. (4680 - 8000) / 8000 = -41.50%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. What is remaining margin?
b. 30% margin requirement
c. rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Initial equity is 50% * 40,000 = 20,000.
Final equity is 20,000 + (40 - 50 - 2) * 1000 = 8,000
b. 8000 / (50 * 1000) = 16%, so yes
c. (8000 - 20000) / 20000 = -60%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An open-end fund has a net asset value of $10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of 6%. What is the offering price?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10.70 after offering price, so offering price = 10.70 / 0.094 = 11.38&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering price is 12.30 with a front-end load of 5%. What is the NAV? NAV = 12.30 * 0.95 = $11.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You purchased 1,000 shares at $20 with a front-end load of 4%. Securities increased in value by 12%. There is a 1.2% expense ratio. What is the rate of return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFF = 20 / 0.96 = 20.83&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final value = 20  * 1.12 * (1 - 0.012) = 22.13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate of return = 22.13 / 20.83 - 1 = 6.24%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loaded-up fund has an expense ratio of 1.75%. Economy Fund has a front-end load of 2% but an expense ratio of 0.25%. Assume rate of return is 6% before any fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LU = 1000 * 1.06 * (1 - 0.0175) = 1041.45 → 4.1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EF = 1000 * (1 - 0.98) * 1.06 * (1 - 0.0025) = 1036.20 → 3.62%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bank A: 4.58% APR, m = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank B: 4.5%, m = 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank C: APR if compound is 12?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 * (1.0458 ^ (1/12) - 1)  = 4.4867%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Continuous compounding
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Square root the variance to ge the standard deviation of the monthly return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can skip the manual calculations and use the VAR and STD formulas provide by Excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get the SKEW of the data by using the SKEW function on the returns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually calculating the SKEW
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a column and instead of squaring the deviation, cube it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide by the number of rates MINUS 1, and then multiply by the standard deviation cubed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use =KURT to get the kurtosis of the rates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 is NORMAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lowe the Kurtosis the tighter in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a. what are the investment proportions in the minimum-variance portfolio
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the formula, we get wE =17.39% and wB = 82.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. what is the expected value and standard deviation of the minimum variance portfolio rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected return is then 13.39%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard deviation (square root of portfolio variance) is then 13.92% (the formula uses covariance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. what are the weights, expected return, and standard deviation of the optimal risky portfolio?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wB = (Excess return of the bond * rE^2 - Excess return of equity * Cov(rE, rB)) / ( excess return of rB * rE^2 + excess return of equity * rB^2 - [excess return of B + excess return of E]Cov(rB, rE))&lt;/strong&gt; (TODO: turn into latex equation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wB = 54.8%, wE = 45.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected rp = 15.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STD(rp) = 16.54%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you wanted to use the risk free?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected return of complete portfolio = 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expected return of complete portfolio = wFrF + wPrP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14% = (1-wp)8% + wp15.61%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14% = 8% + wp (15.61% - 8%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wp = (0.14 - 0.08) / (0.1561 - 0.08)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wp = 0.7884&lt;/li&gt;

- (38 - (-2)) / (25 - 5) = 2
- (12 - 6)(25 - 5) = 6/20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the expected return on each stock if market returns are equally likely?
- Give each scenario a 50% weighting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the T-bill is 6%, and the market return is equally likely the be 5% 25%, draw the SML for this economy.
- E(rm) = 15%
- Draw a line from 6% to 25% when Beta is 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot the two securities on the SML graph. What are the alphas of each? Characterize each company in the above table as underpriced, overpriced, or properly priced.
- alpha is .3% for the defensive, -6% for the aggressive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many researchers have used a market model to estimate abnormal returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rt = a + b * rmt + et&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rt: stock return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rmt: market rate of return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et: firm-specific events return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b: sensitivity to market return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a: average rate of return if market returns 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;et = rt - (a + brmt)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stock&amp;rsquo;s return over and above prediction based on broad market movements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected Return vs. Abnormal Return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the analyst has estimated that a = .05% and b = .8. On a day that the
market goes up by 1%, you would predict from Equation 11.1 that the stock should rise  by an expected value of .05% + .8 x 1% = .85%. If the stock actually rises by 2%, the analyst would infer that firm-specific news that day caused an additional stock return of 2% - .85% = 1.15%. This is the abnormal return for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segregation of certain decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental accounting effects also can help explain momentum in stock prices. The house money effect refers to gamblers&amp;rsquo; greater willingness to accept new bets if they currently are ahead. They think of (i.e., frame) the bet as being made with their &amp;ldquo;win- nings account,&amp;rdquo; that is, with the casino&amp;rsquo;s and not with their own money, and thus are more willing to accept risk. Analogously, after a stock market run-up, individuals may view investments as large ly funded out of a &amp;ldquo;capital gains account,&amp;rdquo; become more toler- ant of ris k, discount future cash flows at a lower rate, and thus further push up prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coupon / (1 + r)^t + Par value / (1 + r)^T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steady: compound periods, maturity date, coupon rate, face value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing: price and yield to maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price and Face Value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When price is above face value, coupon rate &amp;gt; yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coupon rate and yield to maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yield &amp;gt; coupon rate, price is less than face value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it weren&amp;rsquo;t? Then there would be easy profits to be made. For example, if
investment dealers ever noticed a bond selling for less than the amount at which the
sum of its parts could be sold, they would buy the bond, strip it into stand-alone zero-
coupon securities, sell off the stripped cash flows, and profit by the price difference . If the bond were selling for more than the sum of the values of its individual cash fl ows, they would run the process in reverse: buy the individual zero-coupon securities in the STRIPS market, &lt;strong&gt;reconstitute&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., reassemble) the cash flows into a coupon bond, and se ll the whole bond for more than the cost of the pieces. Bot h bond stripping and
bond reconstitution offer opportunities for arbitrage- the exploitation of mispricing
among two or more securities to clear a riskless economic profi t. Any violation of the
Law of One Price, that identical cash flow bundles must sell for identical prices, gives
rise to arbitrage opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;YTM assumes coupons are reinvested at the YTM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realized compound return is also a yield but is assumes that coupon payments are reinvested at the reinvestment rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forecasting the realized compound yield over various holding periods or investment horizons is &lt;strong&gt;horizon analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices of bonds with different coupon rates converge near maturity&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Investment period&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-year bond selling at par value that pays an annual 10% coupon with a reinvestment rate of 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future Value = 1,000 + 100 + 100 * 1.08 = 1,208&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realized compound return: 1,000 * (1 + r)^2 = 1,208&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can apply to mortgage interest rates as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates can be fixed at 1, 2, 3, etc. By forwarding rates, we can look at the best deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the 1 year rate need to be 4 years from now, to be indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liquidity preference theory: forward rate is higher than expected rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;yield curve reflects expectations of future interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forecasts are clouded by liquidity premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upward sloping curve
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rates are expected to rise or liquidity premium to hold long term bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield predicts business cycle
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term rates tend to rise in anticipation of economic expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inverted yield curve may indicate falling interest rates and signal a recession&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the discounted cash flow for each time a cashflow is received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the weights for each discounted cash flow as a percentage of the price (present value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply each weight by the period in time (e.g. cash flow in period 2 multiplied by 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macaulay&amp;rsquo;s duration is the sum of the time-weighted discounted cash flows in the previous step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weighted each time by the present value of cash flows at each time divided by the price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multiply each weight by the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duration equals the maturity for a zero coupon bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duration &amp;lt; maturity of a coupon bond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;present value of a cash flow at a time divided by the price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;modified duration is the duration discounted by the yield divided by the number of periods in a year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modified duration goes back a period because of better results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;expected price % change = -D * (change in interest rate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assets with the same duration are equally sensitive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;divide duration by number of periods in a year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sensitivity is different at each duration&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings management is the practice of using flexibility in accounting rules to improve the apparent profitability of the firm. We will have much to say on this topic in the next chapter on interpreting financial statements. A version of earnings management that became common in the 1990s was the reporting of &amp;ldquo;pro forma earnings&amp;rdquo; measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barrier
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depends on the price at expiration as well as if the price crossed a barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knock-out: if the price falls to a certain extent, the option expires worthless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;knock-in: if the price does not fall to a certain extent, the option expires worthless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lookback Options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depends on the minimum and maximum price of the underlying asset during the life time of the option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call option may provide payoff equal to maximum - strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currency-translated options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asset or exercise prices denominated in a foreign currency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quanto: fix exchange rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digital options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed payoff if a condition is satisfied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put-call parity theorem is an equation representing the proper relation between put and call prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violation implies arbitrage opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell high side, buy low side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invest cash from sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C+\frac{X}{(1+r_f)^t}=S_0+P&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose C = 3, P = 3, X = 60, r = 5%, and stock price is 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell stock: + 60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell put: + 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy call -3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest -57.14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net: $2.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year or so, the investment becomes $60; You can either buy shares back at 60, your shares get called back at 60 because
of the put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good &amp;ldquo;risk-free&amp;rdquo; asset is CASH.TO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, 1 year expiry. OTM Call has premium (price) 30.48. Put has a premium of 43.50 with strike of 370.
Strike price is 370. risk-free rate is 4%. Stock price is 345.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30.48 + 370/1.04 = 345 + 43.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long straddle is established by buying both a call and a put on a stock, each with the same strike price and expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straddle is a bet on volatility. The cost of a straddle is the sum of the call and the put, P + C.
Final stock price must depart from X by this cost for the straddle to provide a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strips&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;straps&lt;/em&gt; are variations of the straddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to options however with futures and forward contract, there is an obligation to follow through with the agreed-upon transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward contracts call for future delivery at a currently agreed upon price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price holds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futures contract obliges traders to purchase or sell an asset at an agreed-upon &lt;strong&gt;futures price&lt;/strong&gt; at contract maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price may fluctuate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero-sum game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit is zero when spot price equals the initial futures price&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hedgers

&lt;li&gt;Protect against price movements&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violation of the parity relationship gives rise to arbitrage opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investor holds $1,000 in a mutual fund for S&amp;amp;P500/TSX Index
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividends of $20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The futures contract with delivery in one year trades for $1,010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since delivery doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the delivery of the dividends, the investor can hedge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect hedge should return the risk less rate of return&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Invest in the Stock Market as a Canadian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My updated investing article. I wrote this with an emphasis on risk &amp;amp; safety rather than beating the market and gaining absurd returns. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the basics. By this point, you should realize that a stock is a type of share of a publicly traded company and a share at its most basic definition is some form of right to the company&amp;rsquo;s equity portion on their financial position. You could say a share is part ownership, but some stocks don&amp;rsquo;t have voter rights, and even if some do, there&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a controlling shareholder. Thus, from the perspective of most individuals, shares are simply rights to the equity of a company.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start investing, you will need to open an account it through a platform called a brokerage. A brokerage allows you to trade shares of companies, baskets of stocks (aka ETFs and exchange traded funds), and derivatives of stocks (aka options).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend opening a QuesTrade account now that they have $0 commissions. When you open an account, you will be asked what type of account(s) you wish to open.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you open an account, it&amp;rsquo;s best to learn about the different types of accounts that are available in your country of residence. Accounts that are defined by the government are called &lt;em&gt;registered&lt;/em&gt; accounts and normal brokerage accounts are called &lt;em&gt;unregistered accounts&lt;/em&gt; and are ubiquitous across countries. For example, Canadians have access to these registered accounts. The maximum amount you can contribute to these accounts is listed under your account information with the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;registered-accounts&#34; &gt;Registered Accounts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#registered-accounts&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room for this account will increase by thousands of dollars every year you are a resident of Canada regardless of income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room is cumulative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contribution room will increase a year after withdrawals (not quite a year actually, but not within the same tax year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room available on CRA website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax deductible contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawals are taxed and do not increase the contribution room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room is cumulative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room increases based on salary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html&#34;&gt;Home Buyers&amp;rsquo; Plan&lt;/a&gt; lets you withdraw up to a certain amount with the condition that you repay it. I suggest reading the link above for when you do plan on making a withdrawal as the rules are ever-changing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution room available on CRA website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Home Savings Account (FHSA)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to open an account when you turn 18 even if you don&amp;rsquo;t plan on contributing to it until your 22 or something, so that you can benefit from the 1 year accumulation and contribute double when you save a lot in one working year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax-deductible contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifetime contribution limit of $40,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yearly contribution of $8,000 which accumulates for only a single year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you don&amp;rsquo;t contribute to the FHSA for 3 years. year 1: $8,000 contribution room, year 2: $16,000 contribution room, year 3: $16,000 contribution room, year 4: $8,000 (deposited $8,000), year 5: $0 (deposited $16,000)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One plan per child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/estimating-amounts.html&#34;&gt;Information about the RESP as well as grant eligibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a way to optimize this plan, but I forget&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max out FHSA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While FHSA is still available, contribute max of $12,000 per year to RRSP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you already own a house, contribute the amount you think you won&amp;rsquo;t need until you plan to retire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to marginal tax rates, your withdrawals could be taxed lower than your current income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margin: ability to buy shares with borrowed funds or borrow shares to sell
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use margin to borrow, then it can get very dangerous because you will be trading with &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example of leverage: Suppose I borrow $99,000 and I only have $1,000 and I buy a stock which goes down by 1%. I lose $1,000 of my own money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This type of account is useful to apply some non-leveraged options strategies which I mention at the bottom of the article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the risk of options trading, you may be restricted from using them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I recommend investing at least two years&lt;/strong&gt; before trying to use options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing is something everyone can do. Trading is a different ball game and requires sophisticated strategies and perspectives on the market. Both are used to grow capital, however investing is inherently less risky than trading. Investing capital growth relies on the weighted average performance of the shares you own, whereas trading may rely on a few concentrated shares. We&amp;rsquo;ll first go over two ways to invest, and one way to trade. For each strategy, I recommend investing 11% Canadian and 89% U.S. just for optimal diversification (population ratios). The easiest way for a company to increase its profits is via population growth, which is why I recommend this ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With IBKR, I suggest just using the platform as the fees are very affordable. With other brokerages however, I suggest employing Norbert&amp;rsquo;s Gambit to avoid percentage foreign exchange fees. This is incredibly simple for RBC. Buy DLR and sell (short) DLR.U. RBC will settle both balances automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIth a brokerage like Questrade, I usually value invest, so I buy a bank stock traded on the TSX and NYSE and then ask the brokerage support to journal the shares that I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on holding. So I might buy 300 shares of TSX:BNS, and then journal 270 of them to NYSE and then sell them. Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, the stock has appreciated while holding it for a few days, and technically speaking if stocks are priced to return capital, stocks should be going up most of the time anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passive-etf-investing&#34; &gt;Passive ETF Investing
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#passive-etf-investing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way to invest, is passive. Passive investment can be done by purchasing ETFs, which are baskets of shares in companies that particular ETF says they hold in. For passive investment, funds that encapsulate 100+ stocks based on market-cap or location are recommended. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview&#34;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; index is the defacto market index whenever people mention or talk about the stock market in the context of North America. It is so influential that the concept of risk-adjusted returns (Beta) of individual stocks and ETFs is compared to the market (S&amp;amp;P 500) return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long-term passive investing, I recommend the following portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International ex-USA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$DISV (35%): small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$VSUX (30%)
Index ETF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA (25% of the global economy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$AVUV (15%): US small-cap value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$EQL.TO / $RSP (10%): US equal-weighted SP500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discretionary (10%)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either stock picking or one of the ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to use Norbert&amp;rsquo;s gambit to avoid FX-fees when buying DISV, VXUS, and AVUV. If that&amp;rsquo;s too complicated, just buy VEQT.TO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.invesco.com/ca-en/exchange-traded-funds/invesco-s-p-500-equal-weight-index-etf---cad&#34;&gt;TSX:EQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.invesco.com/us-rest/contentdetail?contentId=e3fc7c23dbd92610VgnVCM1000006e36b50aRCRD&amp;amp;dnsName=us&#34;&gt;RSP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf&#34;&gt;DISV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of these index ETFs are market-cap weighted, a lot of them can easily be concentrated among big tech which are companies that typically outperform during bull runs and outperform during bear runs. Typically a bull-ruin lasts longer than a bear, so the advice is to invest in these concentrated &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; ETFs during a bear run and keep investing in them until the bull run has surpassed the previous highs by an annualized 10% return. At that point, it may be more prudent to switch to investing in equal-weighed ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value investing is where you have the capability to value a stock. Valuing a stock is incredibly difficult, as it has been proven that most hedge funds and mutual funds cannot outperform the returns given by investing in the market. Still, with value investing, you need to rely on diversification. From studies, the risk of your portfolio can be reduced to systemic but the marginal improvement diminishes at around the 20 stock market. What does that mean? Invest in chunks of 1/20. So if you can only find 6 stocks that are under-valued, you invest 14/20 of your cash in a market ETF, and only 1/20 in each of the stocks you picked. This way, your portfolio&amp;rsquo;s performance isn&amp;rsquo;t impacted drastically by the business risk of a few handful of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real example of business risk that I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered is NEP, which has been renamed itself and its ticker to XIFR. This company turned out to be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/how-to-spot-a-dividend-value-trap/&#34;&gt;value trap&lt;/a&gt;. I was betting partially on interest rates to be cut, and that the dividend (payout ratio &amp;gt; 1) would sustain any continued hemorrhaging. However, what I did not expect was for the company to rename itself to distance itself from its close-arm partner Nextera Energy, and announce that the dividend would be suspended and redirected to paying off the debt. I should start a RED FLAGS list because I could&amp;rsquo;ve saved myself money if I treated any smell as a red flag. With this company, I bought into it multiple times and didn&amp;rsquo;t sell the excess weight when I did recoup my losses. Anyways, what was the end result after a year of investing? I had a profit of ~30%, and after the loss my profit is 21%. This makes sense if the Beta of the portfolio is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Thesis idea&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research the average percent of companies that had negative returns under 0% to under 20%. Also make sure to account for stocks that are acquired and delisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is META in 2022. It actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the business is doing well, the market can perceive the company to be doing poorly. By diversifying, your portfolio will continue to perform at the market, and can outperform the market after you re-balance it. A re-balance would be selling some shares in stocks that you don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to outperform anymore, and topping up losers as if you just invested 1/20 of your portfolio. Sometimes, you may want to double your position. Doubling your position is very risky because you don&amp;rsquo;t to risk timing the stock&amp;rsquo;s bottom. I highly suggest doing it whenever the stock drops 10%+. When a stock that you deem is under-valued (and isn&amp;rsquo;t a fairly valued growth stock) drops by this much, you can view it as a discount. Capital markets theory even dictates that prices adjust down to improve the expected return. So if a stock goes down by 5%, the stock&amp;rsquo;s value goes down &amp;hellip; because it&amp;rsquo;s expected to return a set percentage. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain this, but think about wanting a 10% return and the company is doing well. You find out today some information that makes you think the stock is worth less. You still want 10%, but you know the value of the company must be lower to achieve that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active investing is outlining a strategy, such as growth/momentum and having a very short-term horizon where you could be buying and selling a stock the next week. Day trading is not active investing, as day trading is never about trading based on opportunity, and the losses of day traders make that clear. Never day trade, never look at stock that are momentum, because there&amp;rsquo;s a high chance you did not purchase the stock at the day&amp;rsquo;s lowest. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to predict the future, yet day trading only works if you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-orders&#34; &gt;Types of Orders
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-orders&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit order: a bid to buy a stock at a max price OR an ask to sell your stock at min price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limit order can either be non-marketable or marketable. When you place a limit order that is marketable, that means you will acquire/sell your shares but have set a price that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to exceed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market order: buying whatever the sellers are offering and vice versa. Use with discretion when the spread for buy and sell is small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;option-contracts&#34; &gt;Option Contracts
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#option-contracts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchasing option contracts (option henceforth) can easily become gambling since it&amp;rsquo;s hard to gauge how much money to use to purchase an option. At the basics, an options contract provide the holder an option to do something with the underlying share it is linked to. For example, options that gives the holder the right (not obligation) to buy shares at a specific price (the strike price), is call a Call and an option that gives the holder the right to sell shares at a specific price is called a Put. Options have expiry dates, so holding onto an option with an unfavourable strike price would mean that if the underlying stock does not move to a favourable price, your option may expire worthless! Similar to a margin account, options are a leveraged strategy. However,  &lt;strong&gt;Your loss is limited to your cash purchase.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s very useful for short-term speculations, where you are 99% sure of some sort of event, but of course, speculation backed by hunch is gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options can also be used in lieu of owning shares for a slight bump in leverage. The hardest part of purchasing options will be valuing them. There are all sorts of models, both academic (Black-Scholes-Merton) and proprietary. Options can be at the money (strike price very close to or equal to the market price of the stock), in the money (favourable to execute the option. The strike price is less than the market price for calls and the strike price is higher than the market price for puts), or out of the money (the price is purely based on the models or speculation, and are not executable as the strike price is not in the money). Lastly, options are usually priced at a per share basis but represent 100 shares at a time. So if I a call option for IBM is trading at $1/share and I purchase one options contract, I pay 100x. This is somewhat where the leverage comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to allocate some money to a stock you can&amp;rsquo;t even afford 1 share of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What not to do: purchase a call option with a strike price close to the market price of the stock with an expiration date nearby. This is speculative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you could try to do: Purchase a call option that is (a) dated far out (b) is as deep in the money as you can afford
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every couple of months, you may want to &lt;em&gt;roll&lt;/em&gt; the contract. A roll is when you sell your contract and buy a further dated contract in one order and pay/receive the difference in market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend employing this strategy if you can afford many shares of the company, because shares can move double digit percentages without you being able to foretell. Even if you roll the contracts, option contracts are usually not free to trade on Canadian brokerages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you hold a call option with a strike price of $10. The option is in the money and you want to take your profit. You can either sell the option at the market price which is most preferable or you can exercise the option. Exercising the option doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you get shares for free, it means that you will pay $10/share for 100 shares (1 contract). This is important to understand if you want to take part as the options writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose (in a margin account) you own shares in a company that you don&amp;rsquo;t think will move significantly within your time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write (sell) a Covered-Call: If you own multiples of 100 shares, you can sell out the money call options such that if the share price is above the strike price, you will only miss out on the gains, but will not be losing money, unlike a Naked Call, where you are on the hook for the price difference. You get paid for giving away your right to have your shares taken away from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to own shares in a company that you don&amp;rsquo;t think will move up significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write (sell) a Cash-Covered Put: If you are have $6,000 and are willing to hold that much of a company, then you can write a put option at strike prices less or equal than &lt;code&gt;6000 / 100^n&lt;/code&gt; and you get a deposit for selling someone the right to sell their shares to you. You must ensure that you are writing only as many put options as you can cover using cash. For example, 1 put option at a strike price of $60 takes up $6000 of your entire buying power, even if you do have more than $6000/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Futures are similar to options but most sides have an obligation to deliver or take delivery of the underlying assets. The underlying asset could be equities or even goods. Sometimes the delivery is cash-settled due to how these contracts are used by investors. If a contract is cash-settled, it&amp;rsquo;s usually used for hedging rather than for budgeting purposes. Equity futures are most important for traders predicting the direction of the market (see E-Mini futures) or for institutions who want to hedge their portfolio and change its risk without having to buy many different options. For more information, I recommend reading my notes for &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-423&#34;&gt;Options, Futures, Swaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sike! There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;investing&amp;rdquo; in crypto-currency. You are either gambling or want to be a part of the P2P cash adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoiding-yield-traps&#34; &gt;Avoiding Yield Traps
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#avoiding-yield-traps&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest red flag is when the dividend yield is higher than the EPS. In these scenarios, the dividend is funded by cashflows and not income, and at a certain point in the future, when that cashflow is required as capital investment, the dividend cannot be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason why cashflow is higher than net income, and that reason is usually depreciation which indicates that in the future, a capital investment (cashflow only transaction) will be made. Thus, it is imperative to judge a companies dividend based on their net income and not their cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One situation where it&amp;rsquo;s not a red flag is if the company has had dividend increases for 50+ years. If the company has not been around for that long, just assume it&amp;rsquo;s a yield trap. Technically, you could get away with using a % of the yield to buy puts that are equal to a drop of the yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second situation where it&amp;rsquo;s not a red flag is if a company had a spinoff, because the dividend is expected to be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
