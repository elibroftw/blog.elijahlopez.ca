      <title>Gold vs S&amp;P500 Annualized Return by Month Invested (Jan 1975 - Sep 2025)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gold crossed $4,000 per troy ounce on October 7th. Given this milestone, I wanted to investigate the claim that gold is a better investment than the S&amp;amp;P500. When people usually share their charts showing Gold versus the S&amp;amp;P500 &lt;em&gt;index&lt;/em&gt;, there are a few biases I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed. Of course, the same day I started doing my analysis on this topic, CNBC puts out an article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/gold-vs-sp500-returns.html&#34;&gt;gold vs. sp500 long term returns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most egregious bias in my opinion, is the investment year is cherry-picked (e.g. peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000), and along it comparing against NASDAQ instead of the S&amp;amp;P500. To account for this bias, I have charted the difference in returns for all years, and annualized them to make teh results more digestible, since total returns aren&amp;rsquo;t comparable across years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another bias is that people will cherry pick years very long ago without accounting for executive order 6102 which prohibited owning gold from 1933 until the &amp;ldquo;International Development Association Appropriations Act of 1975&amp;rdquo; was passed, legalizing owning gold starting from January 1st, 1975. This bias is accounted for by restricting the time frame from January 1st, 1975 to the most recent data available for comparison (September 1st, 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third bias is comparing against the S&amp;amp;P500 index rather than teh S&amp;amp;P500 total return index which incorporates dividends reinvested. Big shout out to Robert Shiller for maintaining this dataset for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End date: Sep-2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_vs_sp500_plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, since 1975, the S&amp;amp;P 500 manages to outperform gold on a y/y basis 70% of the time (note that this is based on investing at the start of the year). The cool thing about gold is that it has a Beta coefficient of around 0.5 (Yahoo, using GLD ETF as a proxy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the initial plots which show the performance for the two different types of investments, I noticed that since 1997 to the present day (include the monster returns of 2024 and 2025), there are periods where an investment in gold - a zero-cashflow generating asset - would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed the S&amp;amp;P500 - cash flow generating securities. After that there are periods where an investment in the S&amp;amp;P500 would&amp;rsquo;ve outperformed gold. This makes some sense once you factor in that gold is not correlated to S&amp;amp;P500. Once the market crashed and started going up in March 2009, due to the great financial crisis, there was opportunity to shift from gold into the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use a 10-year window, the results are bit more different, suggesting that over the long-term the S&amp;amp;P500 will outperform gold. The periods where the S&amp;amp;P500 outperforms are taller and the dot-com bursts are deeper compared to the all time annualized performance, however even on a 10 year period the pre-1995 bull market provided excess returns over gold as well as the post-GFC bull market. These make it very clear that gold is not a buy always hold forever instrument but rather an instrument to bring into play when investors speculate that the risk-free real interest rates is lower than what they desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_10yr_rolling.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price 10 year window&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was definitely a year (2012) where you should&amp;rsquo;ve sold gold for bonds or stocks. The year is 2012 and inflation starts dipping below 2%. The Feds start cutting rates, however its clear that holding USD will provide a provide a positive enough risk-free real rate of return. So what happens to gold? It falls to its &amp;ldquo;fair value&amp;rdquo; and stays there since inflation is being tamed, as made clear with interest rates rising from 2016 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/gold-vs-sp500-returns/gold_sp500_ratio_plot_35_years.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gold vs S&amp;amp;P 500 Performance&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions that arise after looking at the graphs are why is gold going up in 2024 and 2025, whether this is similar to 2012, how to avoid another dot-com bubble situation, and lastly, how do we know when the top is in regarding the business/debt cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the provided charts, the gold price rise seems to be a reflection of both the  &lt;strong&gt;declining confidence&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s ability to control inflation as well as its status as a safe haven asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is inversely correlated with the expected risk-free real interest rate. Gold is also seen as a safe-haven asset. Meaning that the real interest rate could be flat, but the existence of some fear, like tariffs, could cause mass buying of gold. What factors determine the expected risk-free real interest rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expected inflation rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2025/08/20/us-budget-deficit-forecast-us1-trillion-higher-over-next-decade-watchdog-says/&#34;&gt;increase in deficit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tariffs (import prices are higher)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury Yields (1yr or 10yr)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Feds Fund rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/treasury-yields-and-gold-prices-breaking-expectations&#34;&gt;Treasury yields and gold prices: breaking expectations (March 25, 2025)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the inflation data, the 1yr treasury bill yields, and the actual Feds Fund rates, a relationship can somewhat be determined between expected inflation, expected risk-free real interest rates, and thus gold prices. When the expected risk-free real interest rate falls, gold is viewed as the stronger store of value. This seems to be because treasuries get crowded out due to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/10/staff-analytical-note-2025-25/#Money-market-mutual-funds-have-experienced-high-growth&#34;&gt;lag&lt;/a&gt; in people pulling money out of money market funds as interest rates get cut. The lag is 1yr.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#fishers-equation-and-real-interest-rates&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept of real interest rates comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/bu-473-investment-management#interest-rates-and-inflation-rates&#34;&gt;Fisher equation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_e=N(1-t)-\pi_e&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;real risk-free required rate of return&amp;rdquo; varies by investor type. This is possibly due to differences in taxation. If all participants seek similar post-tax real rates of return, then where they are situated may affect how the bid on securities, and if the market is small enough, it may crowd out investors with higher marginal tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Tax Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions based in zero-tax jurisdictions could drive down pre-tax real returns for all market participants to match their own post-tax expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commodity Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;: institutions are less likely to be able to crowd out commodities like gold, thus it gives all investors ane better chance at pursuing investments that meet their desired risk-free real rates of return when treasury bills don&amp;rsquo;t meet the bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold Outlook&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the Gold Price to S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Price Ratio over the last 30 years, a gold price crash appears unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Valuation&lt;/strong&gt; (Chart 2): The TR CAPE excess yield metric suggests the S&amp;amp;P 500 is not currently in a speculative bubble. This metric compares the yield of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio against the inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TR CAPE excess yield metric is the difference between the yield of the SP500 Total Return Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings (TR CAPE) ratio minus the 10-year Treasury yield adjusted for inflation. The implication is that when treasuries offer a better real return than the market, the market is definitely in a bubble since it would be be poised to underperform treasuries on a real basis for the next 10 years. That or it would require a long-term sustaining bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAPE takes into account the business cycle and TR takes into account the various method of returning cash to shareholders (dividends, buybacks, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;systemic-crashes&#34; &gt;Systemic Crashes
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#systemic-crashes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market crashing is systemic. There are multiple factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Cycles
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a business cycle is going down, it is called a recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment ratios will go up and down just due to the nature of a business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The business cycle is what central banks are tasked at shortening, however it is not a solved problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally I think recessions are characterized based on the employment data because unemployment is the problem, not a fall in economic growth. If economic growth exists and people are unemployed, then there is still a crisis because people are struggling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless, a traditional GDP based recession metric is clearly a follow up on a decrease in employment, where the recession becomes a reality if the loss in jobs is long-enough to cause a decrease in consumption, which would result in a decrease in earnings, which decreases stock prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt crisis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recession becomes a debt crisis when a lot of capital is tied to &amp;ldquo;never ending growth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debt crisis occurs when a lot of capital is tied to being owed money from over-leveraged entities who can go under due to even the smallest of mishaps. In the GFC, the subprime mortgage instrument combined with over-leverage meant that a minor real estate correction would wipe out the Lehman Brothers, and of course a fall in employment is going to prevent real estate from continuing to go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black swan events (e.g. lockdowns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in the possibility of a black swan event (e.g. COVID-19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharp rise in interest rates causing valuations to plummet due to a higher required rate of return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, interest rates stopped rising. This in turn started a bull market due to risk-premiums being fixed. As interest rates were hiked in 2022, the market risk-premium necessitates that the required rate of return is higher. When the required rate of return rises without the stock market already having corrected, a rise in the required rate of return (based on expectations not just rate announcements), would immediately cause downward pressure on stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34; &gt;Looking Forward
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#looking-forward&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to pursue live graphs that show a simple risk factor as to how likely forward earnings will miss expectations (and thus cause a systemic crash) barring external and black swan events. On top of that, because systemic crashes cause even good stocks to go down, there needs to be a super simple tool that can figure out which stocks were oversold. In a market crash, one of the reasons for asset sales is the lack of liquidity itself! Stock valuations aren&amp;rsquo;t just a reflection of fundamentals but also of liquidity (supply &amp;amp; demand). Some factors that are interesting to me are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation (to predict interest rate announcements, however bank analysts will probably do this themselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jobs data (to predict and visualize where the economy is in the business cycle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;risk-free interest rates (to know what the market&amp;rsquo;s required rate of return is)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the required rate of return is a combination of Beta, equity-risk premium, and the risk-free return. The equity risk-premium is not necessarily static, however it must be a positive number. My theory is that it depends on the various opportunity costs available at any point in time. As time goes forward and as investment innovations increase, equity-risk premiums should be rising, however they can fluctuate due to government policies providing or removing incentives for certain industries and sectors. We must also be aware that the equity risk premium is affected by investable wealth. Meaning that the larger the security in terms of market capitalization, the lower the equity risk premium is to compensate for the fact that more capital to invest also means less available investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year treasury prices and yield versus gold (specifically for analyzing periods of distress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several prominent economists have warned about speculative bubbles and irrational market behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/strong&gt; (December 5, 1996, &amp;ldquo;The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets&amp;hellip; But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Franco Modigliani&lt;/strong&gt;, Nobel Laureate (March 30, 2000, New York Times):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The expectation of growth produces the growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up. But once you are convinced that it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>What is Perfect Competition</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/what-is-perfect-competition/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 02:08:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/what-is-perfect-competition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit my notes on Perfect Competition so I can reference the concept in different posts. The assumptions are as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products in the industry are 100% identical
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same specification products &amp;hellip; if the specifications are different, that means its two different products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not patentable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The industry is vast (true for farmers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each firm is very tiny in comparison to the size of the industry (true for farmers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a firm shuts down or enters the industry, market price won&amp;rsquo;t go down (i.e. prices don&amp;rsquo;t go down everywhere)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms take the price set in the market by the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms cannot charge more than the market price
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double the quantity, double the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the ask price, get no sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms will exit the industry if they make negative economic profit (accounting profit minus potential income from alternative business)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic profit example: a Canadian computer programmer works as a barista. His economic profit is probably negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No barrier to enter or exit the industry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of barrier is highly important here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All businesses have startup costs, but a barrier regarding costs, would be that the cost is &lt;em&gt;unreasonably high&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All businesses have legal duties, but a barrier regarding legal duty, would be an unreasonable legal duty (i.e. the business has to have a compliance officer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(All) producers and consumers are fully aware (open knowledge) of the market (prices, quality, availability)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is true for farming, because you can go to multiple grocery stores and farming markets, see prices of futures, and see news for shortages/gluts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Why an ASIC-Resistant Proof of Work Algorithm is More Secure than an ASIC-friendly Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/asic-resistant-is-better-than-asic-friendly/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 23:57:51 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/asic-resistant-is-better-than-asic-friendly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34; &gt;TL;DR
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tldr&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASIC-Resistance PoW Algorithm allows mining on devices not exclusively allocated for mining, without being at as much of a disadvantage to a ASIC-friendly PoW Algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows mining using existing hardware without paying liquidation fees or profit margins to increase hash rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not have perverse incentives for ASIC manufactures; i.e. if an entity can improve ASICs internally,  they only sell it to the public once mining said blockchain becomes less profitable than selling to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Botnets = free hash rate security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOES NOT REQUIRE MARKET CAP TO BE HIGHER FOR AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY (NETWORK SECURITY).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for society, it does not reallocate capital to technology used exclusively for the purpose of mining a single cryptocurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing for profit miners to buy specialized hardware increases their risk of mining a non-defacto cryptocurrency whereas general compute can be reallocated as soon as operational profits drop. With Asics, companies would just stop mining and declare bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34; &gt;Preface
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#preface&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider two coins, where the only difference between the two is that one uses an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm, (called powR), the other is ASIC-friendly (called powF) (definition: it is mined most efficiently by specialized hardware that specializes in said proof-of-work algorithm, and is less effective at other tasks due to the nature of the coin requiring new ASICs to be created). Both have an equal number of not-for-profit miners who invested the same amount of money. e.g. Ryzen CPUs vs ASICs. Without introducing the other miners, the difficulty (measured in total comparable hashrate, TCH) is the same at the moment. One point to note is that network hashrates are usually not comparable between blockchains that use different proof of work algorithms. It&amp;rsquo;s a question of cryptography, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re only interested in the concept of comparable difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-for-profit-miners&#34; &gt;Not For Profit Miners
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#not-for-profit-miners&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;rsquo;s introduce zero-capex (capital expenditure) not-for-profit miners. These are people who already own the computing hardware and repurpose it to mine the coin. Due to the explicit nature of the ASIC-friendly coin, the TCH of the ASIC-resistant coin is going to go up by a higher percentage. I will prove it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume for every dollar in investment and operational cost, A(ASIC)s are more efficient at mining powF than G(ENERIC) hardware is, and for powR, ASIC is less efficient (and thus does not exist for powR). This is a valid assumption because the definition of powF is to be more efficient using ASICS. Even if powF is unprofitable to mine with A, it would be even more unprofitable to mine with G. Got it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a demonstration. Say the efficiency is 2x. There is older generic hardware G&amp;rsquo;, which is said to be half as efficient as G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 3 miners/pools contributing to each network with the following hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two miners with hardware G&amp;rsquo; (said to be less powerful than G), want to start mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powF: AAA G&#39;
New difficulty: (6.5:6 = 108.3%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;powR: GGG G&amp;rsquo;:
New difficulty: (3.5:3 = 116.7%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the powF fan will sell their existing hardware for money, which will most probably be done at a discount to its market value, and thus will be buying something that is not exactly half of A. In other words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = $1k
G = $1k
G&amp;rsquo; = $500 (market value)
G&amp;rsquo; sold = $499 (G&amp;rsquo; is not a hot commodity by definition, and must be sold at a discount to market value to get money in hand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that G&amp;rsquo; can be sold for market value, there exists some person with hardware G&amp;rsquo; that wants to use only a % of their hardware for mining. This is true, and so even in the best case scenario, it will be more profitable to mine powR than powF with existing hardware. It actually gets even more insane if you design the most ASIC-friendly algorithm. The greater the efficiency of ASICs at mining powF compared to Generics, the greater the increase in difficulty required from powR before existing hardware users even consider mining powR (from a profitability standpoint). To recap, for not-for-profit users that don&amp;rsquo;t want to dedicate their existing hardware to mine their preferred blockchain, the users of powR will be increasing the difficulty of the respective blockchain by a higher percentage than the users of powF (assuming equal users and equal existing hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34; &gt;Botnets and Cost Advantaged Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#botnets-and-cost-advantaged-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With botnets, powR is getting mined more than powF and it&amp;rsquo;s still proportional to how ASIC-friendly powF is. If ASICs are 10x more economically efficient than generic hardware, then botnets are going to prefer powR for 10x more price-adjuated difficulty (i.e. share of TCH * price of powR has to be less than the same calcualtion of powF). Botnets mine powR, and have an incentive to not compromise the network as it is profitable without operational costs. With botnets selling the powR coin for profit, the powR market cap will be going down over time at a rate faster than the powF coin, but the multiplicative rate of defline will not be greater than the difficulty multiplier (otherwise botnets would mine powF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ASIC-resistant algorithm powR has a higher difficulty than the ASIC-friendly algorithm powF, even before we introduce profit-seeking entities. What this also means is that if profit to mine is zero or less, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for a bad actor to take over the ASIC-friendly network than the ASIC-Resistance network (every $ invested represents a higher share of hashrate for the ASIC-friendly blockchain compared to every $ invested in the ASIC-resistance blockchain). &lt;em&gt;Note that in the long-run, due to how relatively low the barriers to entry &lt;del&gt;will be&lt;/del&gt; are to mine blocks, mining profit (excluding speculation) does go to zero.&lt;/em&gt; Even for ASIC-friendly blockchains, since they want ASICs to be created by anyone (and thus accessible to as many people). It&amp;rsquo;s actually worse if ASIC-friendly algorithms don&amp;rsquo;t want ASICs to be easily created. If the market for ASICs are not &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/what-is-perfect-competition&#34;&gt;perfect competition&lt;/a&gt;, the the players in the market can simply gatekeep their ASICs and mine with an advantage, which could also compromise how decentralized the mining is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point, it is less profitable &lt;em&gt;to buy hardware&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of mining powR rather than powF because mining powR would increase difficulty by a smaller percentage than mining powF (assuming the same initial capital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a hostile actor, it is cheaper to attack and take over the powF blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this statement to be false, the assumptions are unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person that would rather mine using their existing hardware than swap it. (hypothetically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swapping generic hardware for specialized hardware has zero loss of capital. (false due to used goods having varied prices and have also depreciated, especially electronics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person who would mine using generic hardware part-time. (false since Monero is proof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the security of a blockchain (difficulty) should not depend on the assumption that the market cap of the blockchain is high enough that state actors can&amp;rsquo;t meaningfully impact the blockchain. Why? Because in the real world, every blockchain grows its market cap over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;profit-seeking-entities&#34; &gt;Profit-Seeking Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#profit-seeking-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two types of profit-seeking entities. One is speculative, which all coins loves, the other is non-speculative and looks at operational profits (that is they sell for fiat immediately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generic-hardware-entities&#34; &gt;Generic Hardware Entities
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#generic-hardware-entities&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For entities (individuals and companies) that already hold generic hardware, they will be checking the relative profitability of each coin. In the instance of dedicated mining, entities will swap generic hardware for specialized hardware, thus increasing difficulty of powF. However, if the profitability is the same between the two coins, the generic hardware entity will always prefer mining powR, because it does not require swapping to ASICs. Thus we can assume that powR still has a higher difficulty than powF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of part-timer generic entities, powR is going to have a higher profit margin as mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;investors&#34; &gt;Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A for-profit entity, ELL&amp;rsquo;s Mining Corporation, is a pure-play profit-maximizing (obviously) blockchain mining company. It has come across both the ASIC-friendly blockchain and the ASIC-Resistance blockchain. The company DOES NOT SPECULATE IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND SELLS ALL MINED CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR PROFIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All mined coins are sold for fiat profit. This is similar to Ethereum swap trade front-runners (bots) which are coded to sell all coins to profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELL&amp;rsquo;s mining corporation is a profit-seeking cryptocurrency mining corporation that seeks to maximize profits. It has a positive hurdle rate and will not invest for zero net present value (unfortunately my corporate finance notes are still in Word and Excel files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now mining powR is less preferable to mining powF, but there are three factors that favour powR to powF. There&amp;rsquo;s two factors that make powF less enticing, but one of them assumes that R&amp;amp;D would need to be done to create ASICs (which in that case, the blockchain is very insecure). The second factor would be that the ASIC vendors have profit margins, but that is an argument to showcase that requiring ASICs is a waste of money on top of providing less security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;powf-is-more-profitable-than-powr-and-has-positive-profitability&#34; &gt;powF is more profitable than powR and has Positive Profitability

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the assumption is really that mining powF has a positive net present value. We already established that powF is more profitable to mine than powR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for powF to have a positive and higher net present value compared to powR? The profit-seeking entity will compare projected cashflows from a mining operation (assuming selling to fiat) for both blockchains, and then use a discount rate to figure out the present value of future cashflows. The discount rates &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; differ due the inherent risk of buying ASICs to mine a coin that isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to have the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure-play companies are going to invest in ASICs and mine powF, however the hurdle rate used is higher than powR&amp;rsquo;s. The hurdle rates will never be the same because there is inherent risk in investing in ASICs versus generic hardware. In cases like a mining company, if the only barrier is capital, then the barrier to entry is very low, and its possible that gross profits can become negative due to competitors obtaining lower operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually even higher for ASIC-minded coins because some ASIC vendors are going to have perverse incentives to gate-keep the best ASIC to themselves, and only releasing better ASICs once the other vendors do. AMD and Intel have no incentive to do this with generic hardware, due to the pure-play nature and how multipurpose nature of their hardware, but the ASIC company is very well versed with the blockchain they designed their ASIC for. There is no incentive to even release the first ASIC of the powF coin unless ,,mining profitability is lower than ASIC profit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gross profits are negative, that means revenue from mining is less than the cost to run the hardware. In the case of the generic hardware, once gross-profit is negative, they will switch to general compute, however for the ASICs, the business will simply stop mining. This means that the bankruptcy risk is higher with ASIC mining companies. When the bankruptcy risk is higher, so to will the required rate of return of the company&amp;rsquo;s investors and as such a higher hurdle rate is required from powF. All this proves is that  powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority to powR depends entirely on price. In practice, you could argue that an ASIC-friendly coin is more secure than ASIC-resistance coins just solely based on the market cap difference, but this is true even between two ASIC-friendly coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security of a blockchain should not assume that the net present value will always be highest for mining blockchain compared to other areas, especially from the bigger picture that each of these mining companies could be publicly traded. If the profitability is lower for blockchain companies, less capital will be provided as more companies provide the financial picture. Bitcoin mining companies are great examples of this, and showcases how valuation is entirely dictated by the speculative nature of the operation. In other words, mining can be unprofitable, and in these cases speculative investors are driving security under their assumption that the price will go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;speculative-investors&#34; &gt;Speculative Investors
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#speculative-investors&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculative entities mine coins based on speculation that that the coins will appreciate in value. These firms do not care about operational profit, and thus its rationale that they will allocate the same amount of money to each blockchain they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason to ignore what speculative investors do is because they flee the moment the market hits the top. Tullip mania, Canada&amp;rsquo;s condo market. Speculative investors invest not because of fundamentals, but because of a speculation that the price will keep going up. If speculators are the only reason the price goes up, then at some point, when speculation or authentic demand dries up, speculators flee. There are two scenarios really, one is where powF and powR are both going down in price. In this case there is no speculator demand and security is still better for powR. In the scenario where powF&amp;rsquo;s price is going up faster than powR (which could be slowly going down), the price would have to make powF profitable, and at some point, the selling by profit-seeking entities will stop the price from going up further. But of course, block rewards get cut! But then less profit-seeking entities contribute to the security. The price would have to go up faster than the block rewards get cut for profit-seeking entities to increase security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, powF&amp;rsquo;s security superiority depends on 1) significant botnet that finds mining powR to be the most profitable (implies that powR has economic value) 2) speculators pushing price of powF at a faster growth rate than powR (for life). This last point is very disturbing. In so many cases, speculation has resulted in devastation. A great example is Canada Condo market. Speculation that leveraged condo purchases would outperform the stock market kept pushing the price of condos and pre-construction condos higher where new builds of condos were reaching peak levels. As soon as the authentic demand was softened, the speculators left, and now housing starts in Ontario have collapsed to great financial recession levels! If this happens to powF, then the miners go bankrupt, since their ASICs (balance sheet assets) would plummet in value at the same time that profitability goes down. At least in the case of general compute, there is a bottom to the asset price, but with ASICs and a speculative sell-off, things would look seriously bad.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other non-security argument for why ASIC-resistance proof-of-work is better than ASIC-friendly proof-of-work is one rooted in decentralized and fairness. The purpose is that the blockchain wants to prevent any entity from having a superior dollar invested to hashrate ratio than the common man. Rather than be super ASIC-friendly, Monero went with being super anti-ASIC, which has the additional benefit of not requiring specialized hardware to get started with mining Monero in a competitive environment. Each miner is incentivized to invest in the most efficient general purpose CPUs and to lower their operational costs rather than the alternative which is buying some other hardware which requires the former having economical value to begin with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Proof of Work algorithm prevents specialized mining hardware from dominating the network and allows for fair distribution of block rewards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, Monero 0.15 was released with a permanent proof-of-work algorithm, RandomX, which was designed to run most effectively on general CPUs. Before, this Monero would tweak its proof-of-work algorithm often to ensure ASICs would not be mining Monero. One could argue that Monero lost security every time they did this, however these ASIC miners only existed due to having a competitive advantage compared to the 20% of non-ASIC miners. When the algorithm is no longer ASIC-friendly, it allows more players to mine Monero for profit and thus increases decentralization and network security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34; &gt;Conclusion

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Conclusion, the idea that ASIC-friendliness is a superior security model to ASIC-resistance, is complete fantasy, based on an incomplete picture of how profit-seeking individuals in the real world functions. When the security of a blockchain depends on its price and thus profitability to mine, it diminished the fundamental purpose of the blockchain!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest issue with trade is the unfairness of gigantic economies like China unfairly benefiting from subsidized shipping costs when shipping to developed countries. Life in China is not underdeveloped as if people are struggling to live. Rather life is China is good, freedom is bad. If China was English speaking and had more free speech protections, it would be very competitive in terms of standard of living to western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tariffs that would work would be tariffs slapped on high profit margin items such as luxury cars (e.g. McLaren&amp;rsquo;s, Lamborghini&amp;rsquo;s, Ferrari&amp;rsquo;s), planes (private jets), clothes, vessels (electric boats), etc. which can easily be produced domestically since the labour cost would not eat into the profit margin. Of course, for some of these items, such as FASHION, yes the profit margin is low, but not because of labour. It&amp;rsquo;s also not something I strongly believe in so I would never recommend tariffing them as a priority unless it was significant in terms of contributing to the trade-deficit. An opposite example is Canadian oil. We sell Canadian oil to the USA at a discount. It makes no sense for the USA to tariff Canadian oil since the USA benefits from the lower priced oil! It&amp;rsquo;s an idiotic policy only an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro&#34;&gt;imbecile&lt;/a&gt; would even suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free-trade is good because it allows countries to leverage their competitive advantages to increase global economic output. The only reason a tariff exists against Chinese Electric Vehicles is because our country has subsidized the electric vehicle industry too much to allow competition from China. This is also another reason that the government should try its best not to pick industries. If the government had never picked EV batteries or the electric automobile industry in general as the industry to grow Canada&amp;rsquo;s economy, then there would be no need to tariff Chinese EVs, and consumers could enjoy cheaper EVs. EVs are touted as a panacea to climate change, one I disagree with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/climate-change-as-a-service&#34;&gt;(read: Climate Change as a Service)&lt;/a&gt;. However I&amp;rsquo;m pointing out the hypocrisy in stating that climate change is important enough to tax domestic polluters, but not important enough to ensure the transition to EV is as affordable as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to lower the trade-deficit, such as the one Canada has with the USA when we exclude energy exports, steps should be taken to pursue the alternatives and substitutes to the imported item. In the case of cars, denser cities (zoning reform), and better intercity transportation (high speed rail, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://altotrain.ca/en/posts/green-light-for-development-of-a-high-speed-rail-network-between-toronto-and-quebec-city/&#34;&gt;Alto&lt;/a&gt;) should be pursued&amp;hellip;&lt;em&gt;aggressively&lt;/em&gt;. In Canada&amp;rsquo;s specific case, there has not been an aggressive push. These projects and the housing accelerators zoning reform efforts have been very slow, both taking decades to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Canada is a net importer of vehicles and is in a trade-deficit with the US if we exclude energy. From &lt;a href=&#34;https://economics.td.com/ca-canada-us-trade-balance&#34;&gt;Setting the Record Straight on Canada-U.S. Trade&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove Canadian energy exports from the equation and the trade story flips. Ex-energy, the U.S. enjoys a trade surplus with Canada of around C$60 (US$45 billion). (Chart 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping this argument on its head, Canadian auto manufacturing has room to expand. Canada produces only 14 car models but consumes 325 models. The U.S. produces 121 models of the 328 models consumed by Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Registers a Trade Surplus with Canada in Autos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so the country decides to pursue energy independence and better transportation. Should they give the contract to a single company and overpay? No. Global procurement is key, because importing high-profit goods like machinery, nuclear reactors, and boilers is not a win for bolstering the economy. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ottawacitizen.com/public-service/defence-watch/canada-australia-arctic-radar&#34;&gt;Neither is giving a defence contract to an Australian firm for a project that a Canadian company also specializes in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rent Control Reduces New Housing Builds</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/rent-control-reduces-housing-starts/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:32:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/rent-control-reduces-housing-starts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Searching up arguments against Rent Control is a good way to get lost. When taking a look at Switzerland, where renting is the only possible situation, they have rent control. When asked why it&amp;rsquo;s so unaffordable, you get cop-out answers like &amp;ldquo;not enough space&amp;rdquo; rather than real answers which is NIMBYISM (i.e. opposition to building denser housing). Here are the reasons and logic I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled that rent control is a policy that benefits only those without children. If you want to have children or care about children, or care about people entering the work force, or care about new comers, you should not be for rent control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arguments are adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-18/yup-rent-control-does-more-harm-than-good&#34;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the nuance of how good-willed restrictions and more regulations backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative proposed is to tax everyone higher to provide insurance/welfare for those unable to afford rent increases. But of course, NIMBYs will push for rent control and not a higher tax burden.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My tenant is paying half the rent that the market offers. We can&amp;rsquo;t up-charge them nor can we kick them out. The only way to get paid the higher rent is by renovating the apartment. I know what to do. If the building is old, I build rebuild a new one. If the unit is rental, I will make it a condo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when a building is renovated? That&amp;rsquo;s right, the tenant will not only pay a rent higher than if rent control didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, they might also be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not enough of a reason to be against rent control. If I were for rent control, I&amp;rsquo;d propose two types of policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not for cause evictions should result in the land lord giving the renter market rent or an alternative housing for the duration of the demolition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All renovation permits must be necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No conversion of rental-purpose to condominium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of all these policies, rent-control is dismissed when the law allows the land lord or family member to move in. If regulations are so strong and the market rent is high, and the land lord&amp;rsquo;s house is high, the only thing keeping the land lord or their child from moving into the place themselves are the artificially higher market rents in the city and the shelter costs outside of their city!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reduce-rental-unit-supply&#34; &gt;Reduce Rental Unit Supply
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reduce-rental-unit-supply&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh so you thought rent control with demolition protections can withstand it, but guess what? Rent control policies and these eviction regulations have resulted in a reduction in rental-units! In San Francisco, rental-unit supply reduced by 15%. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is still not enough of a reason, because let&amp;rsquo;s just start taxing vacant properties, right? Vancouver, a city with less than half the population fo Toronto, implemented a the 3% &lt;a href=&#34;https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/empty-homes-tax.aspx&#34;&gt;Empty Homes tax&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. This policy was effective, and reduced vacant properties by 26%. 100% → 115%  → 75%. Enforcement is pretty good as the province conducts random audits on all registered properties. That&amp;rsquo;s a win right? One issue is the self-assessed declaration form. So voluntary compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decrease-in-new-builds&#34; &gt;Decrease in New Builds
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#decrease-in-new-builds&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we finally arrive at the argument that cannot be rent controlled out of because rent control is linked with less rental-purpose housing being built. Already we find that many cities have high development fees on new housing when the populations of many places are on the up-trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if young and new comers could afford to build their own housing units, they would pay a higher cost. The main problem is that there are so  many municipal governments and what&amp;rsquo;s rare is to see a budget that shows that 100% of the developer fees go towards infrastructure needed for new housing. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the higher development fees are the result of infrastructure costs outpacing inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with rent control, the present value and lucrativeness of purchasing a rental property diminishes. Not only are the development fees high, but you need to budget your entire purchase according to the current market rent. If policy allows land lords to increase rents according to inflation, then is it really rent-control if the initial market rent was already high? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. If we took numbers 1 and 1.3 and then limited them to 2% growth, then after 10 years, there is still a 30% gap! There is absolutely no information regarding how long it will take for market rents can come down, but what is known is that building more has a faster impact on market rents than building less. This is apparent in cities like  Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at St Paul, it&amp;rsquo;s clear what rent control policy &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/what-happened-to-rent-control-in-minneapolis&#34;&gt;resulted in&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where a rent stabilization policy approved by voters in 2021 was diluted by legislators after developers began withdrawing building permits in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent control increases credit risk in land lording as well as erodes value. Credit risk would occur when a rogue renter decides not to pay anymore and the landlord tenant board is full. When rents are capped, the profit recovery is longer, whereas with market rent, the temporary losses are more tolerable. A good example is the pandemic where oil prices tanked. Imagine if there was a ceiling for oil. So when demand is temporarily halted, the business isn&amp;rsquo;t just losing money, but is at risk of defaulting on any debt it took, because when oil prices recover, their profits are capped at a level that might not even cover the debt incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have trouble understanding how becoming a land lord is less lucrative when a city has rent control, the fact is that less people want to invest in new housing when rent control exists, and nothing is stopping them from investing in the stock market, which is simply the value of a company increasing rather than fresh capital being used to generate wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When rent control reduces new housing, that just means that providing housing has become the responsibility of the constituents that voted for rent control. That means doing the work required to acquire land, demolish old buildings, and building not for profit co-ops during a time where interest rates are high. It is simply asking too much to leave housing crisis in the hands of people who if they had the skills to run a cooperative, they could afford rental units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-infrastructure-costs-going-up&#34; &gt;Why are Infrastructure Costs Going Up?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-are-infrastructure-costs-going-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even though I am convinced that rent control doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, primarily because new housing is reduced, which moves the responsibility to municipalities, who are comprised mostly of NIMBYs anyways, let&amp;rsquo;s try to reduce developer costs for all. For this section, I want to do some research on why infrastructure costs have outpaced inflation and what can be done about it from the government&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34; &gt;What Happened
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-happened&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the great depression, countries still followed the gold standard, which does handle bank runs well under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp&#34;&gt;fractional reserve banking&lt;/a&gt; with a low reserve ratio. Bank runs can&amp;rsquo;t be handled well since the federal reserve wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to legally pump money into the system. This vulnerability was exploited by a catalyst, which is any event that causes a loss in confidence in financial institutions. The Great Depression is a domino effect with the egregious one being the lack of separation of concern and adequate risk management at Caldwell and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interest rates were hiked, the stock market crashed (as expected). However this stock market crash was exacerbated by traders on margin who got margin called. Buying on margin refers to the concept of borrowing money to buy shares. This combination of lenders being margin called and the stock market crash also resulted in institutions losing money. One such institution was Caldwell and Company. Without the Glass-Steagall Act passed in response to the events of the Great Depression, management at Caldwell and Company were legally allowed to use deposits as capital for investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be common sense today to not do this, but with SVB going down, it&amp;rsquo;s clear companies that can impact the entire country should always be regulated to operate competently. Competition and profits should be made from decisions that do not put the country or customers at risk. Caldwell and Company&amp;rsquo;s investment banking division lost so much money that it resulted in their commercial banks closing down. When commercial banks close down suddenly, it follows that people would lose confidence in all financial institutions. This triggers a systemic bank run. There was no &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fdic.gov/&#34;&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, meaning depositors could lose all of their money due to lenders defaulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed is that the money supply shrank by 25%. If there is less money able to buy the same quantity of goods, prices across the board must fall. This is because some goods are necessities, so eventually deflation would hit all sectors. Since prices went down, so too would nominal profits. And if nominal profits go down, then the crushed valuations of the stock market is not under valued but fairly valued!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, US politicians decided that the reason for the devastation wasn&amp;rsquo;t due to a lack of regulation, but an oversupply of agriculture, so they slapped tariffs, but on more than agriculture. Of course, foreign countries also slapped their own tariffs, and so the loss in global trade of -66%, further reduced economic output, profits, and thus wages and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prevention&#34; &gt;Prevention
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#prevention&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the gold standard, if a bank run were to occur, the bank does not have enough reserves to meet the demand and will go under. This is because the money it is supposed to have, was loaned out, and if people had purchased on margin, there might not be a way to recover that loan in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution would&amp;rsquo;ve been for the central bank to step in and supply the banks money, by increasing the monetary base; since the bank runs results in lower reserves and lower lending, that means that the money multiplier would have been lowered and thus deflation would occur unless the central bank stepped in. Deflation isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing, but if it&amp;rsquo;s occurring because banks failed and people lost money, then deflation occurred not because of massive output production but because of consumption cradling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why didn&amp;rsquo;t the central bank supply the banks money? Well that&amp;rsquo;s easy. The central bank isn&amp;rsquo;t as independent as people say. It has to follow the laws related to the central bank. During the great depression, that would be the gold standard. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise then why countries that got off the gold standard recovered faster. Central banks literally didn&amp;rsquo;t know what they were doing back then either because they thought the gold standard was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold standard simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t be held while the fractional reserve lending system was in place. The only way it could be done is to issue dollars based on the given price but restrict redemptions to bills that the central bank printed. However, with digital printing, the central bank would have to be honest and only accept redemptions at the reserve ratio which is a devaluation, but it would represent the gold standard accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when people talk about gold being better, the advice really only holds true before the gold standard was abandoned. We might not live in that lie anymore, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible there are other lies we are living in right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue&#34; &gt;Prologue
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#prologue&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m all about seeking truth and questioning my beliefs, I decided to question my beliefs based on the reality of relative success that Ethereum and its many Layer 2 blockchains have had in terms of monetary return compared to my beloved Monero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two points to crypto-currency. One is a decentralized global money system, the second is about 100% freedom, and the third is about making money. I still do think that at any point in time*, a cryptocurrency can only cover two. Monero covers decentralized and freedom. Can you make money from it? No; unless you can predict the future that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, most people are willing to compromise on something. Monero&amp;rsquo;s success should not depend on how ethical or moral human beings are, but that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I have come to realize. I can either stay stuck in the past or look at reality and this article that is what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-value-is-assignable-to-layer-2&#34; &gt;What Value is Assignable to Layer 2?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-value-is-assignable-to-layer-2&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Starknet till I got a sizable airdrop from them. Starknet poises itself to be a decentralized layer 2 zk-rollup on top of the Ethereum blockchain. When I first got the airdrop, I foolishly believed their &amp;ldquo;next-gen tech&amp;rdquo; instead of my short-term greed which was to swap to a USD stablecoin. Since it was free money after all, I did not value it as the money I already owned. Rule #1: treat every financial asset at the same risk-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The considerable depreciation got me thinking. All these layer 2&amp;rsquo;s are focused on making Ethereum scalable, meaning that due to the network effect, Ethereum benefits the most anyways. Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s fees are high because of the demand is usage, not because it&amp;rsquo;s arbitrarily high. Not to mention, that in the future, Ethereum can easily add the dynamic sized blocks that Monero has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that if someone who owns crypto-currency didn&amp;rsquo;t know what Starknet was and has only heard of Arbitrum and Polygon, how can normal people like my friends &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; know about it? Before we delve into the value of the second layer, we need to figure out if the first layer has value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum was introduced as a way to supplement money in contrast to Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s ability to become money with some additional features. That is, I view it was a system to decentralize complex monetary transactions. Ethereum does this through Smart Contracts which is code that is executed in a virtual machine by all full nodes. Lastly, what is the value of smart contracts?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first innovations is the ability to create custom tokens that are secured by the ethereum blockchain. These custom tokens can provide a variety of decentralized functionality that ethereum tokens simply cannot without a centralized database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralized-autonomous-organization&#34; &gt;Decentralized Autonomous Organization

    &lt;a href=&#34;#decentralized-autonomous-organization&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first innovations of smart contracts is the DAO. A DAO let&amp;rsquo;s people vote digitally with their cryptographic signatures rather than using a central database (e.g. government ID, corporation shares). By using a DAO instead of a central owner, there is little room for the managers to misbehave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how government voting can be done using digitally using DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 address = 1 vote. Government democracies can be made more efficient by issuing 1 non-transferable and non-revokable token to every citizen, where the private key is attached to a physical card issued to the person. The card should be placed in a safety deposit box or destroyed once the person has been digitally onboard. The government should not be able to strip citizenship, but optionally, a revoke feature may be introduced. Whenever a vote occurs, an atomic unit should be subtracted. To make the chain sustainable, the government can make it so that addresses unused for 50 years are retired (burned). The cons of this system are identity theft and coercion. But these are crimes of which the latter can be reported and the former can be dealt with a smaller DAO with the power to blacklist addresses. Government ID can still be used for in person verification, so I don&amp;rsquo;t believe there&amp;rsquo;s any problem. I won&amp;rsquo;t go very in depth but I do know that this is an area that a tech-first government would invest time researching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stablecoins&#34; &gt;Stablecoins
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#stablecoins&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first useful functionality is tokenomics, which can be used to create stablecoins which have a 1:1 &lt;strong&gt;redemption value&lt;/strong&gt; with a US dollar. A stablecoin cannot be algorithmic as that is how Luna blew up. Tether (USDT) in 2014 was the first USD stablecoin backed by a centralized organization. In 2017, DAI was launched without the centralized overseeing. In 2018, the centralized Circle (USDC) was launched. The problem with centralized backing is that the organization will eventually be bound to comply with the fiat system&amp;rsquo;s regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dai-and-makerdao-mkr&#34; &gt;DAI and MakerDAO (MKR)
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dai-and-makerdao-mkr&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does DAI work if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a depository? DAI is issued by depositing excess collateral of MakeDAO approved ethereum-based assets. That is for ever DAI token you receive, you will have to deposit more than $1 in various assets. When the collateral gets low on value, a collateral auction is triggered to liquidate the collateral for DAI. One thing I learned about money in economics is that for money to have value is has to be perceived to have value and for someone to agree to locking up their money, people must have taken large opportunity costs to make DAI have the value that it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAI is governed by the MakerDAO of which ownership is determined via MKR tokens. The value of the MKR token is the value in influencing DAI and since most of it was with the founders, there is strong incentive to keep it working. If we really think about it, MKR is a security and just like many public companies, it&amp;rsquo;s fine if the founders get a slice. The security&amp;rsquo;s value is also bolstered by the DAO&amp;rsquo;s operational ability to earn interest on loans. I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure on the ways MakerDAO makes money (if at all), but I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards interest rate &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.fi/&#34;&gt;spreads&lt;/a&gt;. So if I were to value MKR, I would want to analyze the financial results earned from these sort of operations. &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/project/maker/protocols/makerdao&#34;&gt;A start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to transact decentralized with the same purchasing power and full ownership is a step closed to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network effect is incredible and when &lt;strong&gt;constantly innovating&lt;/strong&gt;, the benefactor of the network effect is most likely to win out. &lt;del&gt;So with that said, Ethereum is here to stay&lt;/del&gt;. Due to the downwards price pressue back-running is having, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say Ethereum will continue to gain popularity. Even if it fixes this one major problem, alternatives can still grow. As we talk about in the next chapter, &lt;a href=&#34;#fiat-banking-system-versus-crypto-monetary-system&#34;&gt;Fiat Banking System Versus Crypto Monetary System&lt;/a&gt;, if a cryptocurrency is volatile and has a market cap in the billions, its blockchain can be seen as a bank and its token as a stock; &lt;strong&gt;they can all grow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ethereums-back-running-problem&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote this article in 2024, I was unaware of how profound the problem of back-running was. Back-running is when users use a swap service and a  profit-seeking entity unrelated to the swap service, will detect the swap transaction in the mem pool, and buy the coin at the current ask price and then turn around and sells it to the original buyer at a higher price. Users are told to limit the &lt;em&gt;slippage&lt;/em&gt; (amount of market value willing to lose), but that still amounts to losing a few percentage points which can result in thousands of dollars for higher transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this bad? Well you see unlike in the stock market, where high-frequency trading firms are rewarded in the same currency of their accounting books, for Ethereum back-running, revenue will be in cryptocurrency and will need to be sold to crystalize profits in order to reduce price volatility risk.  Think about it for a second. You have an algorithm that earns crypto-currency on 99% of decisions it makes. You, as a business, understand that not only Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s price, but all crypto-currencies at the moment, have price cycles, meaning that it is undetermined whether the price will stay flat or go up in the short-run! Therefore, to lock in profits and reduce the risk of the price going down, you liquidate any cryptocurrency money earned from this algorithm as soon as possible. To improve logistics, you may even make use of ETH/USD stable coin pairs with tight bid-ask spreads. It actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t even matter if you also get back-run when liquidating because you only lose a percentage of revenue rather than a percentage of equity. Since algorithmic profit-seeking entities have an incentive to sell all Ethereum-related crypto-currencies, this puts a downwards pressure on the price of Ethereum. In other words, for Ethereum to maintain its upward movement, there has to be more demand (on a per $ basis) for Ethereum than crypto-currencies without swap mechanisms or loopholes that allow back-running. Put another way, if Bitcoin and Ethereum had the same market cap, Ethereum requires more buyer demand than Bitcoin to sustain its market cap since there are inherently more sellers wanting to offload Ethereum. This problem isn&amp;rsquo;t inherent to Ethereum, I&amp;rsquo;ve just focused on Ethereum because of its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic front-running or simply back-running, actually stems from the stock market due to the stock exchanges all adopting a technology superiority mindset where firms get an advantage for being able to execute trades as fast as possible even though there is no significant material change millisecond to millisecond! In the existing stock market, there are multiple exchanges with markets to trade. If institutions send their trades to the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; priced exchange, because they might eat up the entire bid or ask, the high-frequency trading firms or market makers will adjust their quotes on the other exchanges! You can read more about this in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/university/bu-430&#34;&gt;Financial Market and Security Trading course notes&lt;/a&gt; which also references condense notes of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis which was the ground breaking book informing market participants what HFTs were even doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternative-1-cardano&#34; &gt;Alternative 1: Cardano
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-1-cardano&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main alternative I can think of is Cardano. It&amp;rsquo;s argument is a modular architecture, but there is little focus on what the present implications and wins are over ethereum. It&amp;rsquo;s like saying FreeBSD kernel is better than the Linux kernel because it&amp;rsquo;s modular without mentioning most frameworks support Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that FreeBSD&amp;rsquo;s architecture is superior to Linux because Linux satisfies a significantly higher share of users. As history has shown us, there does exist an opportunity cost of developing software for platforms with less users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we apply this strong argument of satisfaction, Cardano will not replace Ethereum because Ethereum satisfies most people, the smart contracts need to be coded in a more complex language; even if that language is more secure and easier to build on once on-boarded. Just like OCaml, where is the monetary incentive to learn haskell? Ethereum, like Linux, is constantly evolving, and there is little benefit in learning something new to do the same task you can already do at a high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Monero and it&amp;rsquo;s alternative. Monero satisfies the role of money. It&amp;rsquo;s digital cash and anything new cannot beat the network effect unless there is high interoperability and low substitution costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternative-2-solana&#34; &gt;Alternative 2: Solana

    &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-2-solana&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only benefit Solana has over Ethereum is the significantly lower transaction fees and costs. This is due to Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s popularity and so why did it do better than Cardano? Well clearly because if cost is the bottle neck, why settle for Cardano when the cheaper Solana will do? Solana is like an accelerated blockchain where the sustainable solution is to store just the state and not the history. Burning history is what most blockchains will have to end up doing and Solana&amp;rsquo;s solution is just one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my belief that the biggest myth that was perpetuated regarding Solana was that FTX had control over the project other than simply being a prelaunch investor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;m bullish on Monero, bearish on Etheruem in its current form due to back-running. I&amp;rsquo;ve found these rebuttals to credible criticism against Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visible Balances and Transaction History
-I also do not like that Ethereum transactions and balances are visible but
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(1) Most people do not care about privacy enough to change behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(2) Ethereum isn&amp;rsquo;t just about money, it&amp;rsquo;s about decentralized finance (defi). Hopefully someday the Monero community either creates a wrapped Monero like Wrapped Bitcoin or fully polishes atomic swaps. Essentially, ethereum unlocks defi potential rather than being the money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof-of-stake is &lt;em&gt;Permissioned&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The argument spouted by Proof-of-workers is that PoS coins require buying permission but the same can be said about the device we are using. Permissioned is not a good argument when mining itself is not the best way for the average person to acquire a considerable amount of crypto to begin with (i.e either use capital, aka stored labour, work for the cryptocurrency, or inherit it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mining requires acquiring a device capable of mining meaning that you need capital to begin with. Capital (money) you get from working or are transferred to which can be from a PoS or PoW blockchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof-of-stake rewards the wealthiest
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people use Ethereum and do not stake it so the wealthiest is not being concentrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stakers get a constant yield that competes directly with the world nominal interest rate or at least the USA interest rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each staker is rewarded the same proportion of the Ethereum they did stake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less secure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;33% attack
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethereum protects against this via slashing. It is less likely for a staker to sustain the manipulation and forks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak Subjectivity: How does a node know which node is the correct hash?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attack is owning 51% of nodes, which is just as easy to do by a state actor as doubling the Monero hash rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attack will be thwarted because even Monero at one point had one pool responsible for 50%+ which was subsequently reduced
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally there is a big risk in PoS regarding weak subjectivity because with PoW 50% attack, the bad actor has to use a boatload of compute and resources, whereas for weak subjectivity, the bad actor can scale the attack over time with minimal resources. It is easier to setup a node than it is to mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Fiat Monetary System&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Decentralized Monetary System&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Explanation&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Chequing Accounts&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Any Tier 1 Crypto Currency Wallet&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tier 1 crypto-currencies are cryptocurrencies that been integrated in some way with other cryptocurrencies. Think chartered banks that can accept cheques from other banks&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Cheques, e-Transfer, FedNox&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Bridging&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Each bank is a separate entity just as how each blockchain is mostly separate (layer 2&amp;rsquo;s as well). Person A banking with bank X can send a money to person B banking with bank Y, is the same as me with Monero being able to pay someone who is using Ethereum on Arbitrum&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Inter-bank transfer&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sending money on same blockchain or through some sort of centralized broker&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to send a lot of money to someone already at the bank than to send a lot of money to someone who uses another bank. Same thing with crypto-currency.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Savings Account&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Staking or Loaning to a Regulated Crypto Exchange&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;A savings account is not required in a decentralized system since customers will need to explicitly consent to having their be loaned out not to mention that the lack of a fractional lending means that the expected interest rate on sitting money should be 0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crypto-currency-or-crypto-security&#34; &gt;Crypto-Currency or Crypto-Security?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#crypto-currency-or-crypto-security&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the previous table, the first thing everyone does is open a chequing account. In any country, this will usually be one of the biggest banks. RBC, TD, Scotiabank, CIBC, BMO. Since most adults in Canada use these banks, most people are not going to be opening their first bank account with EQ bank nor Tangerine (subsidiary of Scotiabank). Since these banks are publicly traded, we can create some intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Company&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Beta&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;EQB Inc.&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;EQB.TO&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1.63&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Bank of Nova Scotia&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;BNS.TO&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0.96&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta is a measure of how risky an investment is compared to the market. The greater the Beta the greater the factor of return over the market. So if the market grows, a Beta over 1 implies the stock gave a higher return. Likewise, if the market falls, the stock falls harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing it back to crypto-currency, the blockchain is the monetary system that functions, but the token itself is either a currency (money) or a security. If it&amp;rsquo;s a currency or money, it has to meet the criteria of unit of account. Unit of account says that there has to be a way to measure value uniformly. If are measuring token&amp;rsquo;s based on their USD price rather than measuring goods in said token&amp;rsquo;s price, the token is more of a security than a money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are not looking at crypto-currency this way. When searching for stability or unit of accounts I am met with stable-coins (fiat - securities) or &amp;ldquo;divisibility&amp;rdquo; but not volatility analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future I will take it upon myself to conduct a 3-year volatility analysis on all crypto-currencies above 1 billion dollars in market cap. Currently, my intuition is that Monero is more like Money than a security. It&amp;rsquo;s exchange rate has been in the 160-240 range for the last 2 years ($200 +- 20%). Contrast to Canadian dollar, 0.7198-0.8026 (0.7612 +-5%). Clearly we have a few more years to go before Monero can be cemented a currency. The recent de-listing from Binance will only reduce volatility due to speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-money&#34; &gt;Making Money
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#making-money&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my take for people who want to make money. Tier 2 crypto-currencies are shit coins. Unlike the stock market, crypto-currencies are competing as banks and the smaller they are, the more likely they are to fail, more so when &lt;strong&gt;the securities regulator is lagging&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s best to invest in the large-cap cryptocurrencies at the peak, and then rotate into mid-cap crypto-currencies once the bear market has made the currencies flat. Yes, there is higher reward in investing in the mid-cap cryptocurrencies at the peak, but unlike the stock market, the crypto appears to have a much shorter boom-bust cycle (this is not set in stone, as some crypto currencies want to be a currency first and thus will flatten out at some point).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Macroeconomics Asset Market Question (Chegg is Garbage Pt. 1)</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/chegg-is-garbage-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 16:20:08 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/chegg-is-garbage-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider an economy with a constant growth rate of nominal money supply and a constant real interest rate r​ = 0.06. Which of the following statements about the inflation rate of the economy would be​ valid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The​ long-term inflation rate would be equal to the money growth rate regardless of the output growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The ultimate determinant of the inflation rate is how people form their expectation of future inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Without knowing the nominal interest​ rate, π ​+ 0.09​, one can not tell the real demand for money and hence the inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. The faster the​ economy&amp;rsquo;s real output​ grows, the lower the inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer according to Google, Chegg, Homework.Study.com will give you the wrong answer. I ignored them because I trust myself more than even textbooks. I&amp;rsquo;ll break down the problem and give you the solution at the end if you still can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta M}{M}-\eta_Y\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}-\eta_i\frac{\Delta i}{i}&#34; alt=&#34;The inflation rate = % change in money supply - income elasticity of money demand \* % change in real output - interest elasticity of money demand * % change in interest rates&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflation rate = % change in money supply - income elasticity of money demand * % change in real output - interest elasticity of money demand * % change in interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know from theory that when real income/output increases, the demand for money also increases. Therefore, the income elasticity of money demand is positive. We also know that when interest rates go up for non-monetary assets such as bonds, there is a lower demand for money, hence there is a negative interest elasticity of money demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the question, we are told that the growth rate of the money supply is constant, and interest rates are constant. Therefore, only the change in real output can affect the inflation rate. You should be able to figure out the answer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Answer&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster the​ economy&amp;rsquo;s real output​ grows, the less effect money supply growth has on the change in price levels; lower inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since the money supply is growing every year, the economy has to also grow every year to keep the inflation rate lower than without any output growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just goes to show you that sure you can Google a question, but if you are intelligent or have mastered a field, you should have the confidence to disregard information you read online even from &amp;ldquo;trusted authorities.&amp;rdquo; Obviously, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you don&amp;rsquo;t bow down to the scientific method where empirical evidence is king.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-takeaways&#34; &gt;Course Takeaways
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#course-takeaways&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the economy (i.e. output production. aka GDP)?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goods and services created that can we can place monetary value on
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some activities may not be included like people staying at home instead of paying for daycare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;output is made up by capital stock, labour and a productivity factor, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have numerical breakdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are many ways to measure GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without impacting consumption, only productivity determines long-run economic growth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are a variety of ways to improve productivity, read the section on policies &lt;a href=&#34;#long-run-growth-policies&#34;&gt;long-run-growth policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital are assets that people use to generate output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments are made to maintain and grow capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labour
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People choose to make trade-offs between leisure and money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to fund their leisure time so work money for that purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously and unfortunately, there are situations where the person is living to work versus working to live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic Cycle of busts and booms (&amp;ldquo;full employment&amp;rdquo;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;full employment&amp;rdquo; is where unemployment rate equals natural unemployment, something hard to measure and can change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;natural unemployment can exist due to matching issues (e.g. oil &amp;amp; gas jobs went to renewable sector) and due to the &lt;em&gt;friction&lt;/em&gt; of changing jobs (hunting for a job after being laid off)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies can be created to reduce matching issues and Employment Insurance can affect the friction (noticeable between provinces).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shocks are what change the state of the economy drastically
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technology shocks (transistor, internet), productivity shocks (COVID-19), supply shocks (higher oil prices because of OPEC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exists for the sole purpose of making commerce efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money can be interpreted as liquid assets meeting &amp;ldquo;what can be used to buy goods right now&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money supply is influenced by the central bank and is made large because of fractional reserve lending
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each dollar deposited at an institution, if the bank knows it only requires 20% to meet demand, it can lend until 80% has been fully lended (divide by 0.81)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation: increase in the price of goods and services
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be deliberately induced by the central bank
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;central bank policies have a lagging effect so money supply can grow in the past year and its effects may take another year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goal of money supply growth is to reduce interest rates to spur investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money supply has no effects on full-employment in the long-term, short-term is up for debate since it does cause inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the money supply grows, market participants end up realizing their dollars are worth less in a real sense and will increase prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currently most central banks focus on annual inflation, but if they focused on stable price levels, then it would make it easier to properly invest today&amp;rsquo;s money. Inflation targeting results in $1 being equal to a range of values in 20 years rather than a single value, which would be the case if price level targeting was used instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inducement by federal
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crowding out: interest rates go up (lower private investments) because federal government spending too much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;costs of inflation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost of updating price labels:  &lt;em&gt;shoe leather costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unanticipated inflation hurts savers and rewards banks and lenders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hyperinflation: money loses meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unexpected inflation and unemployment are related
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost impossible to keep inflation unexpected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;national income accounts are an accounting framework used in measuring the current economic activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product approach: measure in terms of output produced (sold) excluding intermediate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sum of value-added (output price - input costs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;income approach: incomes received by the producers of output
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tax revenue, wages, after-tax profits (shareholder income?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expenditure approach: spending by the purchasers of output for consumption and not for input
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add up end user purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;goods that are not used up, such as a lathe, are capital goods that are classified as final goods and included in GDP&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stock variables: one point in time (e.g. amount of money in your bank account on December 20th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flow is equal to the rate of change of the stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Wealth = domestic physical assets + net foreign assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net foreign assets: foreign stocks, bonds, and factories owned by domestic residents minus foreign liabilities (domestic assets owned by foreigners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National wealth can change due to the values changing, or national saving dollar for dollar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, national saving can be used to increase stock of domestic physical capital (I) and increase foreign assets&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Real GDP, constant dollar GDP, measures GDP using prices of a base year&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rate of return promised by the borrower to a lender
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nominal interest rate is the rate at which the nominal (or dollar) value of an asset increases over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real interest rate is the rate at which the purchasing power of an asset increases over time&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Real vs Nominal Rates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expected real interest rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrowers and lender act based on this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;r = i - expected inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Expected inflation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult to determine expected rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume public has same expectations as what the government announces or private forecasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extrapolate based on current inflation rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an economies factories, farms, and other businesses all shut down, other economic factors would not mean much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital (factories, machines) and labour (workers, would autonomous AGI robots count?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y = A F(K, N)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y = real output produced in the current period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A = overall productivity (total factor productivity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K = capital stock, quantity of capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N = number of workers employed in the current period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F = Function relating Y to capital K and N&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobb-Douglas production function: Y = A K^a N^(1-a)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under certain conditions, a corresponds to the share of income received by capital and labour gets 1 - a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity and standard of living is highly correlated, but is it a casual relationship? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. There has to be a common cause of both these two variables (obviously one being the income in the previous year, but I&amp;rsquo;d argue we need to look at monthly data since a year is simply the Earth traveling around the Sun but nothing really economical).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since capital stock is long lived and investments only have a significant effect slowly, it is often fixed by economists when analyzing a few years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;year-to-year changes can often be traced to changes in employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assumptions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workers are all alike (ignore aptitude, skills, ambition, etc. ) (why though? I feel that ambition &amp;amp; skills are very important, such as minimum wage jobs and non-minimum wage jobs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firms decide how many to employ, not at what wage to employ, that&amp;rsquo;s determined by competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firms hire based on maximizing profit (true but some company&amp;rsquo;s are hiring for growth and then doing mass layoffs)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the benefit of the extra worker exceeds their cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the marginal product of labour (MPN) equals the real wage (in units of output)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRPN), measure extra revenue produced for adding another worker = Price times MPN
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MRPN = MPN * price = nominal wage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can also state that the real wage is determined by the output, so then we can state when MPN increases, increased employment / real wage increase
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the real wage is cost to employ (nominal wage) divided by selling price per unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The labour demand curve is relationship of the workers demanded and the real wage the firm faces (equal to MPN curve)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be workers per se, could be hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shifts due to supply shocks. Positive shocks increases MPN (and thus employment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing payroll taxes would be a supply shock
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing sales tax is not a supply shock. That&amp;rsquo;s a goods demanded shock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, an increase in capital stock also increases MPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregate Labour Demand
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand for labour of all firms in the economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labour hoarding
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a recession, hiring and firing costs are too much to otherwise layoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;supply-of-labour&#34; &gt;Supply of Labour
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#supply-of-labour&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each person decides whether to work or to do non-work actions (&lt;strong&gt;leisure&lt;/strong&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give as many people possible the right to not work and not get paid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person who wants to make themselves as well off as possible, would work as much such that each hour worked makes up for each hour of free time given up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, real wage = amount of real income that a worker receives in exchange for giving up a unit of leisure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitution effect of a higher real wage: workers supply more labour in response to a higher reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pure income effect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when a worker&amp;rsquo;s wealth increases, the income is less valuable, therefore more time is spent on leisure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when future wages will increase, there is an implied increase in wealth, therefore more time is spent on leisure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-term increase in real wage: both effects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temporary no income effect since workers want to take advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;permanent we see income effect (aggregate supply of labour goes down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size of effect is dependent on each person&amp;rsquo;s situation include tax rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose tax percent has increased just for the current year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less likely to work since the time spent working is definitely less than letting go off leisure and since it&amp;rsquo;s only one year,
the loss of income for one year isn&amp;rsquo;t convincing enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suppose there is a lump-sum tax (value not percentage)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;income effect only, so have to work more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labour Supply Curve
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity of labour supplied for the real wage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shifts right if economy-wide real-wage rises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in wealth increases amount of leisure workers can afford (curve shifts left)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases in expected future real wages increases amount of leisure workers can afford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in working age population increases number of workers (curve shifts right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in the participation rate increases number of workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equilibrium
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical model implies quick real wage adjustments
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assumption is that people would be able to find jobs very quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At equilibrium workers get a wage that just about equals the compensation for surrendering leisure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When neither side is satisfied, something will have to give to get to Equilibrium
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When many workers are competing for few jobs, real wage falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full-employment level (N with line on top) at market-clearing real wage (w with line on top)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have no accounted for unemployment yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A negative supply shock would decrease demand for labour (which equals MPN) at every level of employment so we could get lower wages
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a decrease in demand for labour because the expenditure for non-labour factors are higher and thus there is a lower optimal level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporary, so labour supply curve does not shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since more firms in Canada use petroleum as an input in the production process than produce oil as an output, increases in energy prices have generally been viewed as an adverse supply shock for the Canadian economy as a whole. Canadian firms have become more energy efficient due to these shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;labour-market-equilibrium&#34; &gt;Labour Market Equilibrium
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#labour-market-equilibrium&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People earning under 40,000 (2011 dollars) have been the same since the 1980s, but the middle class is becoming richer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation is that there is unskilled labour and skilled labour, with the latter being the reason for the difference in wage increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled-biased technological change occurs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Employment Output (Y with line on top)  = A F(K, N (with line on top))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education levels do not affect the labour market since the students are not part of the workforce and thus MPN has not actually increased (yet?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things like energy supplies are other factors of production that can definitely impact the labour market (higher costs means higher MPN required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immigration does increase output at full-employment, but of course real wages decrease due to the labour supply curve shifting right
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When skilled immigration increases, the real wages of skilled workers falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When unskilled immigration increases, the real wages of unskilled workers falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y = 9 K^0.5 N^0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPN = 4.5 K^0.5 / N^0.5 [derivative of above]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NS = 110 * ((1 - t)w)^2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K = 25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose t = 0 or t = 0.3. What is the equilibrium real wage and the level of employment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At full-employment, MPN = real wage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;MPN = 400 - 4N&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NS = 18 + 10w + 2T (where T = lump-tax of 38)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the equilibrium real wage and the level of employment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Solution&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming MPN = w,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everyone who would like to work can find a job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54,000 households are surveyed every month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employed (worked full-time or part-time the past week or was on leave/strike)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unemployed (person was without work during the past week, sought a job in the past four weeks, and was available for work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not in labour force (did not work and did not look for a job in the past four weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment-ratio is employed / working-age population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participation rate is the labour force / working-age population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discouraged workers: people who stop searching due to lack of success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unemployment spell: period of time an individual is continuously unemployed and the length of time is called duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of the unemployed, most have long durations, but most people who become unemployed have short-durations (low amount of workers with high churn compared to amount of workers with low churn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasons for unemployment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frictional: searching for suitable jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structural: chronic unemployment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-skilled workers are often unable to obtain desirable or long-term jobs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could be because of inadequate education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reallocation of labour from shrinking to growing industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural rate of unemployment is the prevailing unemployment rate when output &amp;amp; employment is at full-employment levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the actual and natural unemployment rate (u vs u with overbar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My guess is that Canada&amp;rsquo;s natural rate of unemployment is between 5.5% - 5.6% because it was around this in 2019 and was below this during the inflation that occurred during 2022. When rates started going up, so did unemployment and now we are at 5.8% which I believe is still above natural unemployment due to the higher numbers of international students and the hours they can work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Similar the current income expect that expenditures clearly come out of savings and not out of the additional current income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because people own a part of their wealth in equities, the performance of the stock market ought to influence consumption spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another major form of wealth is housing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, one could argue, inflation could be cooled by decimating the housing market. If people who bought houses for investments get wrecked, they will spend more and thus prices will cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;5.7 cents for every dollar increase in housing wealth, but not measurable for increases in stock market wealth&amp;rdquo; - Lise Pichette, “Are Wealth Effects Important for Canada?,” Bank of Canada Review, Spring 2004.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other hand: need smaller amounts to achieve target
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;income effect of the real interest rate on saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to consider people are borrowers as well
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrowers can consume less when they have to spend more on interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the effect on real interest rates and national saving is not very strong but a higher national savings is said to lower real interest rate&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Comments&lt;/summary&gt;
- cars don&#39;t last as long as houses and require financing (interests)
- houses are 10x car prices and have amortization period of 20+ years so higher interest rates means paying more in interest + you need to pay maintenance
- some people are
- interest payments on student loans (not applicable anymore due to federal laws allowing tax deduction)
- the situation where real interest rates rise seems like during periods of high inflation &amp;rarr; less inflation so maybe people had to reduce consumption and the temporary higher real interest rates just allows for returning to normal spending habits
- when real interest rates rise, what are expectations for the stock market? If they are the same, then why would people save more? how many people are actually saving?

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;if &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; is the nominal interest rate and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is the income tax rate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 - i)t&lt;/em&gt; is the after-tax nominal rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected after-tax real interest rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_{a-t}=(1-t)i-\pi^e&#34; alt=&#34;r_{a-t}=(1-t)i-\pi^e&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pi&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the expected inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target overnight rate is the key indicator of monetary policy. The overnight rate itself is what chartered banks make on short-term loans to one another. Where is the repo market and who has access to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reserve ratio:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much banks must keep as reserves which prevents the banks from loaning out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the central bank pays interest on the reserves (interest on reserves) for banks to deposit into the central bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount rate: how much it costs to loan money from the central bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Market operations: central bank can purchase or sell government treasuries which is an opportunity cost for banks when they lend to each other
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is basically subsidizing by the central bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiscal-policy&#34; &gt;Fiscal Policy
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fiscal-policy&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assumption is that fiscal policy does not affect aggregate supply of goods and services and that aggregate output Y is given
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This assumption is everything wrong with the economy. It&amp;rsquo;s why we are where we are and not in the future already&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If governments derived policies that targeted aggregate supply of goods and services in a way that creates jobs and not in a way that competes with other businesses for the G&amp;amp;S it bid for, Canada would be more innovative. How is green technology going to give us all jobs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The textbook says this assumption is valid at full-employment (people who are chronically unemployed can be hired though) and that the policy won&amp;rsquo;t significantly affect capital stock or labour supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affects &lt;em&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which is that $1 less in consuming is $1 more in national saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government spending can come from higher taxes which means less consuming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If governments have to borrow, that means taxpayers have to pay more taxes in the future&amp;hellip;expected future incomes will fall, thus reduced consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any temporary increase in government spending will reduce desired national saving because the new amount saved will always be less than the amount G spent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With tax cuts thrown in, &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers are not going to be thinking about future tax increases, so either government spending goes down the same amount as tax cuts or desired consumer spending will increase and national saving will decrease. If government spending went down an equal amount, then there would be higher national saving because of course not all the income that was kept would be spent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ricardian equivalence proposition: that tax cuts or increases do not affect consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;Current output&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Rise&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Part of the extra income is saved to provide for future consumption.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Expected future income&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fall&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Anticipation of future income raises current desired consumption, lowering current desired saving.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;Wealth&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fall&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Some of the extra wealth is consumed, which reduces saving for given income.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Expected real interest rate, r&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Probably rise&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;An increased return makes saving more attractive, probably outweighing the fact that less must be saved to reach a specific savings target&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;desired-capital-stock&#34; &gt;Desired Capital Stock

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount of capital that would allow the firm to earn the largest expected profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPK&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; is the expected future marginal product of capital which is the benefit from one unit of investment today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000 oven per cubic metre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no operational costs (solar-powered)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% depreciation (10% less efficient every year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrowing rate is 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a cost because for every $ invested with borrowed funds or retained funds, it could&amp;rsquo;ve been earning the interest rate too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the user cost is $180 per cubic metre per year it should equal MPK&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; for maximizing profits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?uc=rp_K+dp_K=(r+d)p_K&#34; alt=&#34;uc=rp_K+dp_K=(r+d)p_K&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;profit maximization after considering taxes: &lt;em&gt;(1 - tau)MPK&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; = uc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;divide both sides by 1- tau to get the &amp;ldquo;tax-adjusted user cost of capital&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actual corporate taxes are on profit not revenues and investment is sometimes deductible
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depreciation allowances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment tax credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore use effective tax rate: what tax rate (tau), on revenue has the same effect as the actual tax code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;q theory of investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Tobin, Yale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that stock prices influence capital investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if Tobin&amp;rsquo;s q &amp;gt; 1, profitable to acquire additional capital since value &amp;gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if Tobin&amp;rsquo;s q &amp;lt; 1, not profitable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tobin&amp;rsquo;s q = V / p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V: stock market value of firm, p&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;K is the replacement cost of the firm&amp;rsquo;s capital cost (Maintenance CAPEX?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher MPK → higher stock prices → higher q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower real interest rates → shift from investing in bonds to stocks → higher stock prices → higher q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lower capital purchase price → lower denominator and higher q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decrease in expected real interest rate, increases desired capital stock
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher capital stock means higher profits meaning higher stock prices as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technological changes increase MPK&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Japan high post flattening of GDP or was it always high?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two opposing forces: purchase or construction of new capital goods  (&lt;strong&gt;gross investment&lt;/strong&gt;)increases capital stock but capital stock does depreciate and wear out which reduces the capital stock. I feel that with software, tech debt does not actually wear until it becomes unbearable and unproductive to use and/or update.
The difference between gross investment and depreciation is &lt;strong&gt;net investment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;net investment = gross investment - depreciation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;t+t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can be replaced with the desired capital (&lt;em&gt;K*&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, the investment cannot be made immediately and might take years as in the case of skyscrapers and nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the most volatile component of investment spending during business cycles&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residential investment: construction of housing, (SFH, condos, apartments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might inventory spending increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add more variety (e.g., for cars) for shoppers to select from to avoid waiting for delivery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expected commission (keeping the same sales force) from the increase dictates the spending inventory level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of holding more inventory (cars): depreciation, financing for the higher inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apartment investments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marginal product is the real value of rents (that can be collected) minus taxes and operating costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the user costs = depreciation, wear and tear, and interest costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;construction incentive: future marginal product is at least as great as its user cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for other types of capital, constructing an apartment building is profitable only if its expected future marginal product is at least as great as its user cost.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what economics forces at play?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real interest rate plays a big part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equilibrium is when aggregate quantity of goods supplied equals aggregate quantity of goods demanded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equilibrium is when Y = C&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; + G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;difference between income-expenditure identity is that there are two &lt;strong&gt;desired&lt;/strong&gt; components, so actual output vs. desired may be different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desired savings (S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;) = desired investment I&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; ; graph with interest rates being the vertical axis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher interest rates make investments more expensive as the competing rate of earning can be met in the bonds market or something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some contradiction as now the text is claiming that higher real interest rates definitely increase national savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently the real interest rate will be bid up. I guess because banks will have exhausted lending, so private credit lends at the equilibrium rate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interest rate represents many rates so things get messy in real world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/images/ec-250/saving-investment-curves.webp&#34; alt=&#34;In an economy with no foreign trade, the goods market is in equilibrium when desired national saving equals desired investment. Equivalently, the goods market is in equilibrium when the aggregate quantity of goods supplied equals the aggregate quantity of goods demanded.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a temporary increase in government spending can result in savings curve shifting left (lower desired national savings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crowding out&lt;/strong&gt; is when government spending (excess demand for resources) causes investment to decrease (due to the higher market-clearing interest rates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently &amp;ldquo;expected increase in future income&amp;rdquo; does not shift the savings curve down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;net export crowding&lt;/strong&gt;: if a fiscal expansion causes the local currency to appreciate, reducing the net exports.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store of value
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any asset could be a store of value&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;open-market operations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open-market purchase: newly minted currency buys financial assets such as government bonds from the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open-market sale: sell government bonds to reduce money supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which assets and how much of each asset to hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expected Return
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the higher an asset’s expected return (after subtracting taxes and fees such as brokers’ commissions), the more desirable the asset is and the more of it holders of wealth will want to own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty about the return an asset will earn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people don&amp;rsquo;t like risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A liquid asset can easily be disposed of if there is an emergency need for funds or if an unexpectedly good financial investment opportunity arises. Thus, everything else being equal, the more liquid an asset is, the more attractive it will be to holders of wealth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to Maturity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amount of time until a financial security matures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefer shorter over longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expectations theory means average of short terms = long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reality: longer = higher returns due to &lt;strong&gt;term premium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed-income securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canadian bonds have very low risk of default. High liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate bonds are higher risk and could be illiquid during troubling times
-Stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small businesses are owned by one or two people and its shares are not marketable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return is profits or selling the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Largest asset for most homeowners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefit of shelter minus maintenance and property taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in value of the land and the house

&lt;li&gt;Very illiquid, could take months or years to sell BUT home equity line of credit (HELOC) is available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable goods such as automobiles, furniture, and appliances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for each asset is how much a holder of wealth allocated for it in their portfolio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US housing crisis: less regulation in the US led to 22% of all mortgages being sub-prime, combined with delayed interest rising resulted in delayed mass default (52% in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Backed Securities containing these loans were sold to everyone even foreign investors meaning that that the collapse affected more than just the USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid and low return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factors:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher price level → proportional demand for more money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70 years ago, price levels was 1/10th meaning nominally, you&amp;rsquo;d need 10 times less money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher real income → demand more money (real means implies more money)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher real income means more spending meaning more liquidity needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not proportional, as higher the income, more efficient investment (might require minimum balance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also lower the income, there might not just be as many attractive alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase in interest rates on monetary assets compared to non-monetary assets → demand more money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;returns on alternative assets can sway the demand for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a decrease in interest rates for non-monetary assets increases demand for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Factors
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in Wealth, small increase in demand for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher risk in alternative assets increases demand for money. Money itself can be risky via erratic inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidity in other assets will reduce demand for money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convertibility to cash (deregulation, competition, innovation in financial markets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency in payment tech will reduce demand for money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit cards, ATMs, debit cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?M^d=P\times L(Y,i)&#34; alt=&#34;M^d=P * L(Y,i)&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = aggregate demand for money, in nominal terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P = the price level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y = real income or output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i = the nominal interest rate earned by alternative, non-monetary assets (e.g. bonds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L =a function relating money demand to real income and the nominal interest rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the interest on monetary assets is less volatile than the interest on non-monetary assets and is thus not statistically included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can also use r + pi^e to express in terms of real interest and expected inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?M^d=P\times L(Y,r+\pi^e)&#34; alt=&#34;M^d=P * L(Y,r+\pi^e)&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divide both sides by the price level to get the real demand for money. Also known as the &lt;strong&gt;money demand function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{M^d}{P} = (Y,r+\pi^e)&#34; alt=&#34;\frac{M^d}{P}=(Y,r+\pi^e)&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;income elasticity of money demand: increase in money demanded for 1% increase in real income. suggested to be 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest elasticity of money demand: increase in money demanded for 1% increase in interest rates on non-monetary assets (NOT PERCENTAGE POINTS. THINK 0.10 to 0.101). suggested to be -0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation decreases as demand for money increases&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn over of the money stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nominal GDP / nominal money stock
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real income / real money demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher velocity means each dollar is being used in a greater dollar volume of transactions (assuming transaction volume is proportional to gdp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity theory of money: real money demand is proportional to real income M&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; / P =kY where k is a constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand for M reduces velocity so innovations such as interest bearing chequing accounts can reduce the velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M1 velocity has been declining over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M2 is long-term stable but not over short-term due to something like the stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;% Change in velocity = % Change in Real Income minus Inflation minus % Change in Money Supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;asset-market-equilibrium&#34; &gt;Asset Market Equilibrium
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#asset-market-equilibrium&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each asset has a fixed-supply, so equilibrium is met when the quantity demanded for each asset equals the fixed supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linked to the price level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two groups: money (M = all assets that can be used for payments. assumed to pay i&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;). non-monetary (NM) assets pay (expected real interest rate + expected inflation rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Md (total money desired by everyone) + NMd (desired non-monetary assets) = aggregate nominal wealth (as in the sum of desired distribution of wealth = total aggregate wealth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M + NM = aggregate nominal wealth (wealth = the two components that make it up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, there is equilibrium when the quantity of money demanded equals the quantity of money supplied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nominal money supply M is determined by the central bank through its open-market operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any imbalance between desired national saving and desired national investment is bridged by foreign borrowing or foreign lending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price factor is nominal money divided by the real demand for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under classic model, government spending increases price levels which means that output does not increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the expected inflation rate decreases, there is lower demand for non-monetary assets (due to lower nominal rates) and thus a higher demand for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;money-growth-and-inflation&#34; &gt;Money Growth and Inflation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#money-growth-and-inflation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth in price levels (inflation) is closely linked to the growth in the nominal money supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{\Delta P}{P}=\frac{\Delta M}{M}-\frac{\Delta L(Y,r+pi^e)}{L(Y,r+pi^e)}&#34; alt=&#34;\frac{\Delta P}{P}=\frac{\Delta M}{M}-\frac{\Delta L(Y,r+pi^e)}{L(Y,r+pi^e)}&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rate of inflation equals the growth rate of the nominal money supply minus the growth rate of real money demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With η&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; (\eta_Y) being the income elasticity of money demand, then in the long run where nominal interest rates are constant, inflation can be stated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation-tall src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\pi = \frac{\Delta M}{M}-\eta\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}&#34; alt=&#34;\pi = \frac{\Delta M}{M}-η \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that nominal money supply growth is 10% per year, real income is growing by 3% per year, and the income elasticity of money demand is 2/3. Then, Eq. (7.12) predicts that the inflation rate will be 10% − (2/3)(3%), or 8% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By subtracting the variable nominal yield on the real return bond from the fixed nominal yield on the conventional bond, the Bank can therefore obtain a measure of inflation expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open economies mean countries can temporarily spend more than they produce (via imports)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;desired investment does not have to equal desired saving when foreign sector is involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When saving &amp;gt; investment, lend in international market (current account surplus). When saving &amp;lt; investment, international borrower (current account deficit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current account indicates how much is available for net foreign lending
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is essentially the net payments/income transferred from and to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current account has three separate components
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net exports of goods and services
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;merchandise trade balance = merchandise exports - merchandise imports
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gets more attention in press than warranted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;services include tourism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foreign students in canada are an export of services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment income from assets abroad
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interest payments, dividends, royalties (credit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payment of investment income is a debit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFP include this plus the wages &amp;amp; salaries of Canadians working abroad but it&amp;rsquo;s small enough to ignore&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current transfers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;payments from one country to the other (e.g. foreign aid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current account balance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add all credit items and subtract all debit items in the current account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;positive = current account surplus, negative = current account deficit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Account = inflows - outflows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the capital account has a surplus, that means that the net foreign assets decrease because there was more inflows (purchases of domestic assets) than outflows (purchases of foreign assets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions where the good being purchased was not currently produced won&amp;rsquo;t be included in the current account. Trade of existing assets is recorded in the capital and financial account. When domestic assets are sold to foreigners, it&amp;rsquo;s a financial inflow (credit) since funds are flowing into Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official Settlements Balance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official reserve assets (not domestic assets, foreign government securities, foreign bank deposits, IMF assets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance of payments or official settlements balance is the net increase in a countries net holdings of reserve assets. Surplus when holdings increase and deficit when holding reduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Account Balance + Capital Account Balance = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning: international transactions are swap of goods, services, or assets
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose Canadian imports  75 CAD worth of goods from British exporter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exporter then purchases 75 CAD worth of pound sterlings from the FX market
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purchase of the 75 CAD counts as a capital inflow (example is the central bank reducing its reserve currency)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure if FX Market counts as a capital inflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical discrepancy when difference is non-zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Foreign Assets and the Balance of Payments Accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;re-definition: net foreign assets: foreign stocks, bonds, and factories owned by domestic residents minus foreign liabilities (domestic assets owned by foreigners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes: value of existing foreign assets and liabilities. acquisition of new foreign assets or liabilities
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net amount of acquisition is the current account surplus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a deficit means selling of assets or acquiring more debt (net foreign borrowing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If new capital bought with foreign debt is highly productive, the foreign debt would not be an economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to calculate savings: Investment plus current account (NX + NFP); CA = GDP - Investment - Consumption - Government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?S^d = I^d + CA = I^d + (NX + NFP)&#34; alt=&#34;S^d = I^d + CA = I^d + (NX + NFP)&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a closed-economy, CA = 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFP determined by past investments so are not much affected by current macro-economic developments. Therefore, just look at net exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total spending by domestic residents is called absorption
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y - National Saving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a small economy cannot impact world real interest rate. Therefore the real interest rate is fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a supply shock can cause savings to decrease and thus the current account surplus falls (if rates are low enough, then the current account deficit increases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a supply shock won&amp;rsquo;t impact investment since interest rates did not increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;globalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globalization in Canada: direct investment (influence management) vs. portfolio investment&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can affect real world interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domestic economy and foreign economy (rest of the world)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the excess savings in the domestic market show up as the desired borrowing (foreign investment minus foreign saving) in the foreign economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the world real interest rate will be such that desired international lending by one country equals desired international borrowing by the other country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current account of the lender country rises (income receives from abroad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sum of current accounts of all countries equals 0 (therefore, equilibrium is one big a system of linear equations)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large government budget deficits and large current account deficits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proposition: government deficit reduces desired national saving and thus reduces current account surplus (reduces capital outflows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deficit due to higher government spending does reduce desired savings and thus also reduces the current account balance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public savings decreases, so unless consumption decreases, national savings goes down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deficit due to tax cuts (meaning no reduction in spending) will increase consumption if the Ricardian equivalence does not hold
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one thing to note is that in the long run, tax cuts without a reduction in government spending might end up hurting the national wealth as the interest paid by the government won&amp;rsquo;t be going to all Canadians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would require an increase in private saving, a decline in investment to offset, or a rise in current account deficit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decline in investment is unlikely as the government is either demanding more domestic goods or demand is maintained
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% saving is not possible due to the Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) which is ???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;trough&lt;/em&gt; is the low point in a business cycle and a &lt;em&gt;peak&lt;/em&gt; is the high point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A severe recession is called a depression. Sequence from one peak to the next is called the business cycle. Properties include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluctuations of aggregate economic activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature expansions and contractions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that business cycles have become less severe, attributed somewhat to better monetary policies, but it could simply be better measurements, more job variability, or a lot of things. There&amp;rsquo;s no proof that all these factors will always be there, especially when some countries are not appealing to live in (e.g. UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business cycles are periodic (bound to happen) but not known when to happen or the interval for it (not recurrent)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;economic variables can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;procyclical: moves with the business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;countercyclical: moves against the business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acyclical: does not depend on business cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comovement: many economic variables having regular and predictable patterns over the business cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;timing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;leading&lt;/strong&gt;: occurs ahead of of aggregate economic activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coincident: occurs at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lagging: occurs behind economic activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production (procyclical and coincident)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expenditure (procyclical and coincident)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;labour market variables (employment is procyclical and coincident; opposite for unemployment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money growth (procyclical and &lt;strong&gt;leads&lt;/strong&gt; the  business cycle)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meaning: high money growth comes before business cycle expansion and lower money growth comes before contraction. Could also be counter-cyclical since Bank of Canada is trying to influence the economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPI inflation is procyclical but lags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;financial variables (e.g. stock prices are procyclical and lead the business cycle)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead is like 1 month, so losses in stock market are followed by contractions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durables vs. nondurables
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can put off purchases of durable goods when times are tough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output is more volatile than total hours&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, higher the price, lower the real interest rate. There is a different MD curve for each output Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Productivity falls temporarily,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FE shifts left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price level adjust since IS and LS have a gap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real wage, employment, and output decline; real interest rate and price level at higher equilibrium point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temporary inflation (higher price level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumption and investment are lower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not consistent is that the real interest rate might not increase due to mismatched expectations; apparently if the shock is expected to be permanent, rates would not rise; the lesson says the shock was temporary, but historic oil prices shows that the oil prices stayed steady after 1974 till the next shock, whereas oil prices decreased after 1980. Real interest rates only rise if the expectation is that it is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1973-1974 Oil shock: USA gave $2.2B to Israel and OAPEC (OPEC Arab countries) decided to have an oil embargo on the USA. It is pretty clear that people would think this shock would be permanent. It&amp;rsquo;s not really clear why oil prices remained high even after the embargo ended in 1974. Prices most likely remained the same due to the devaluation of the USD by that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in domestic money supply shifts the LM down, causing the domestic interest rate to fall below the foreign rate. Arbitrage opportunities induce capital flow into foreign from domestic, depreciating the domestic currency. A depreciated currency makes net exports cheaper, shifting the IS curve to teh right. The end result, assuming a fixed price-level, is an equal interest rate, depreciated currency, and higher net exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long-run, keynesian model shows monetary neutrality which occurs immediately for the Classic model; real exchange rate unaffected but nominal exchange rate is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nominal exchange rate is official set by the government, possibly in agreement with other countries. If the fundamental rate, determined by free market participants is less than the official rate, then the currency is overvalued. Responses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country can devalue the currency (by reducing the exchange rate) but if it did this a lot, it might as well employ a flexible-rate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country could also restrict international transactions to reduce the supply of its currency to the foreign exchange market, thus raising the fundamental value; even though this is suppression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country could purchase its own currency via the central banks official reserve assets (gold, foreign bank deposits, and special assets created by agencies like the IMF). Reserve assets = balance of payments deficit. This method has its limits since some countries ran out of gold and thus a currency devaluation was inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, an undervalued currency can&amp;rsquo;t be maintained for long by foreign central banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An undervalued currency can also be responded to by increasing the money supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If the dollar/Swiss frac exchange rate falls, then?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dollar more valuable&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swiss imports more from Canada into Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;canadian firms export more to switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;swiss franc more valuable relative to the dollar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2002-2008 canadian dollar against US dollar appreciated due to net exports increasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If foreign interest rates decrease, then exchange rates rise and net exports decrease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Canada&amp;rsquo;s real interest rate rises relative to British real interest, we expect net exports to decrease but exchange rates to rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase is domestic income decreases net exports, increase in foreign income increases net exports. An increase in the domestic real interest rate results in a higher real exchange rate and a net exports decline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the short run in the Keynesian model for a small open economy with flexible exchange​ rates, an increase in the domestic money supply would cause domestic output to​ rise and the domestic real interest rate to​ fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for an undervalued currency in a fixed exchange rate, the country can increase money supply; if money supply is increased too much it may make the currency over-valued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;european union agreeing to use the euro is called a currency union. all countries in the currency union must share a common monetary policy.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;business cycle theories have two components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of the types of shocks believed to affect the economy the most&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a model that describes how key macroeconomic variables respond to economic shocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;real-business-cycle-theory&#34; &gt;Real Business Cycle Theory
&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggests that real shocks to the economy are the primary cause of business cycles; Real shocks affect the IS curve or the FE line while nominal shocks are shocks to money supply or demand which affect the LM curve. Examples of shocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the production function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of the labour force,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the real quantity of government purchases, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the spending and saving decisions of consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important shock is supply/productivity shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most economic booms result from beneficial productivity shocks; while most recessions are caused by adverse productivity shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase/decrease in government spending &lt;strong&gt;has a wealth effect&lt;/strong&gt; (higher future taxes means poorer and income effects leads to more labour supply) that results in an increase/decrease in labour supplied shifting the FE line to the right/left resulting in an increase/decrease in the full employment level of output. Classic economists are against dampening the business cycle through fiscal policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unemployment-in-classical-models&#34; &gt;Unemployment in Classical Models

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the classical model unemployment is just mismatched workers and jobs. With shocks, there is an increase in the matching problem. IMF reported great deal of churning of jobs but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain all unemployment (e.g. temporary layoffs; timing). You&amp;rsquo;d think more help would be needed during recessions but they fall. Government can reduce regulations on business or reduce minimum wage instead of fiscal policy that does not improve the matching problem (I mean the government can always expand government jobs).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;procyclical is explained by &amp;ldquo;reverse causation&amp;rdquo;; the change in money growth precedes changes in output does not mean that the money growth caused the output changes.

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada wants to increase the demand for money by reducing the interest rate which requires a higher money supply so that businesses can get money they want easily and handle future sales. For example, just before christmas the money supply increases (gift-buying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A producer&amp;rsquo;s wage is equal to the price of the good being produced. Price and output is related (higher the price more goods are produced and vice versa). The producer has to use previous expectations of the current price level to estimate the actual price level. So if there is an expectation of 5% inflation and price of bread increases by 5%, then baker retains output since the real wage has not changed. Therefore, the change in output can simply be due to the difference between the general and expected price levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=equation src=&#34;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Y=Y\bar+b(P-P^e)&#34; alt=&#34;Y=Y\bar+b(P-P^e)&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see here that supply can be higher if the actual price level is higher than the expected price level. This is because suppliers will think the a portion of the actual prices is real and will increase output to capture the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although Long-Run Aggregate Supply is vertical, Short Run Aggregate Supply is a curve swinging upwards intersecting when P = Pe. Anticipated monetary policy has no effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If expectations are correct, the expected price will equal the actual price. The central bank has to surprise people to affect output but it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the central bank would want to increase money supply during recessions and decrease it during booms and so only a random policy would have effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an increase in money supply, there are two price level adjustments since one occurs before labour contracts are renegotiated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Classical model in the previous chapter, anticipated or unanticipated government spending influences wealth and the full employment output, whereas in the Keynesian model, participants anticipate the effects of the fiscal policy and negotiate a wage that would maintain the real wage (no change in wealth). With an unanticipated fiscal policy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal and monetary policies are both referred to as aggregate demand policies because both policies affect the position of the aggregate demand curve. Only unanticipated fiscal policies have a long-term affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less than one-third of the Canadian labour force is unionized and covered by long-term wage contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some labour contracts are indexed to inflation, so the real wage is fixed, not the nominal wage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real wages are procyclical no counter-cyclical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empirical evidence on price stickiness is not conclusive; sticky in response to monetary policy shocks and flexible in response to shocks. Exchange rate pass-through is slow or incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopolistic Competition
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices are set in nominal terms and maintain those prices for some period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output adjusted to meet demand at the nominal price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices adjusted from due to significant changes in costs or demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu Costs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the price means printing new menus which costs money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For firms that have some monopoly power,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price = (1 + Markup) * Marginal Cost&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recessions are undesirable because the unemployed are hurt. Government policies can quickly restore to general equilibrium but would increase price level in the long-run tha if no action was taken. In my opinion, there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to fear people being unemployed if people could get a reduction in their tax bills equal to their estimated savings. Someone with $0 in savings should not have to pay as much in taxes nor should they get less in EI than someone who has $100,000 in savings. The latter can still maintain their assets so if anything EI should be as normalized as possible across the board. Secondly, there should not be a labour surplus during non-booming times. The government can also fund education during times of recessions so that people out of job can still get educated for skilled jobs that have labour shortages (grants given for specific programs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase in gdp / increase in spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the US economy the multiplier is sometimes zero during periods of full employment to 1.5 in periods of recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore, maybe best to run surpluses with full employment and deficits during recessions to avoid the price increase&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;effort vs real wage is an S curve. There is a sweet spot just before effort flattens off (tangent to line from origin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;therefore market-clearing wage &amp;gt; efficiency wage determines unemployment. Labour supply - Labour demand = unemployment and unemployment does not reduce real wages*&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Unanticipated inflation vs. cyclical unemployment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In classical, Misperception theory is used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Aggregate Demand increases unexpectedly, cyclical unemployment will be negative because more employment than natural is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: think money supply is expected to increase by 10% (output remains equal), but increased by 15%. Price level increases less than 15% because output is increased as there is a belief that relative prices of goods are higher when they are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If unemployment rate is higher than natural, that implies that actual inflation is higher than expected inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength of the relationship is related to the slope of the SRAS curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the expected inflation increases, the curve shifts to the right (higher unemployment rate for the same inflation rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the natural rate of unemployment increases, the curve shifts to the right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For adverse supply shocks, classical blames the increase in natural unemployment to higher levels of mismatch between workers and jobs whereas keynesian blames it on higher than ideal real wage.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classical: high energy costs transfers jobs from the energy users to energy providers (makes sense)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phillips curve moves up and to the right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beneficial supply shock leads to the curve moving down and left&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical: stabilization policies are futile because of quick self-correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynesian: possible for unemployment rate to deviate from natural rate for an extended period of time
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus when AD falls and unemployment increases, government can use AD to increase inflation again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lucas Critique&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new policies change the economic rules, and so no one can safely assume historical relationships will continue to hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;applies to phillips curve when policy makers thought they could increase inflation to reduce unemployment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;natural unemployment rate corresponds to full-employment output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unsure when we are at full-employment output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hard to figure out what the natural rate is so not a good idea to pursue policies in pursuit of this number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demographic
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;women have equal or lower unemployment rate nowadays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;younger workers have higher unemployment rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological changes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher skill requirement which reduces employment opportunities for low-skilled or poorly educated workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(see the Application “Technological Change and Wage Inequality” in Chapter 3, p. 74).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hysteresis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the tendency of the natural rate of unemployment to change in response to the actual unemployment rate, rising if the actual unemployment rate is above the natural rate and falling if the actual unemployment rate is below the natural rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;downturns in economies with high levels of worker regulation tends to persist more due to firms not hiring workers that will never need to be fired (pessimist hiring versus optimistic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment Insurance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacement ratio: benefit relative to lost wages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;benefit duration: amount of time an unemployed worker receives benefits for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eligibility requirements: what does the worker need to do to collect benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disincentive index: disincentive to search for jobs and accept job offers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no surefire method for reducing the natural rate exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easier for workers who have been made unemployed by a shrinking industry to retrain and find re-employment in expanding industries
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a case can be made for such policy measures as tax credits, subsidies for training, and relocating unemployed workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goal: eliminate mismatch between workers and jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recent modifications of EI emphasizes retraining and encouraging workers to move to where new jobs are created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimizing size of payroll taxes firms pay when employing workers. Cost to employ includes contributions to EI, Worker&amp;rsquo;s Compensation, Federal and Provincial (Quebec) Pension Plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hysteresis proponents: aggressive monetary and fiscal policies (high pressure)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not a good idea as it is high risk for a loosely validated problem of skill deterioration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely more policies that could be applied and more discussion should be applied in this area. For example, the textbook does not discuss information gaps between government organizations and individual workers, unemployed, and future workers. If innovation drivers economic growth, then shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worker&amp;rsquo;s be made aware of programs that they can contribute to. Or how to incentivize workers to become forefront of innovation (e.g. university grants in sectors that aren&amp;rsquo;t saturated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anticipated inflation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prices of goods and services would increase 4% every year, but so would nominal wages. No purchasing power harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nominal interest rates would adjust to offset drop in purchasing power; money saved would earn the real interest rate regardless of the rate of the anticipated inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoe leather costs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs incurred to reduce holding the cash whose value erodes due to inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated to be 0.3% of GDP for 10% perfectly anticipated inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu costs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost of changing nominal prices; lowered by technological progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unanticipated Inflation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest earned in savings account is a less than expected in a real sense which is a gain for the Bank paying the interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lenders and savers get hurt, fixed rate borrowers or people with fixed payments benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyperinflation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extremely high for sustained period of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;workers paid more often&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher shoe leather costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the real value of taxes collected by the government falls sharply during hyperinflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when prices aren&amp;rsquo;t reliable indicators of supply and demand, then markets cannot allocate resource efficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sustained monetary growth in industrialized countries is usually due to not tightening monetary policies during times of over full-employment output but using expansionary policies during recessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disinflation by ways of slowing reducing the money growth may lead to a serious recession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if policies succeed in reducing inflation below expected rate, unemployment will rise above the natural rate until inflation expectations lower&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;rapid disinflation / reduction in money supply growth. Since it&amp;rsquo;s dramatic, public ought to reduce expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynesian disagree because of an adjustment period which brings in delays and that people might expect the government to abandon the policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynesian &lt;strong&gt;gradualism&lt;/strong&gt;: reduce rate of money growth and inflation gradually over the years; effective due to being politically sustainable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sacrifice ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amount of output lost when the inflation rate is reduced by 1 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the total output loss as a % of one year&amp;rsquo;s GDP, and divide it by the reduction in inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different in every country, sometimes less than 1 and sometimes up to 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flexibility of the labour market. The higher the flexibility, the lower the sacrifice. The higher the regulation, the higher the sacrifice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rapid disinflation tended to have lower sacrifice ratios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to determine if Laurence Ball&amp;rsquo;s estimate on the loss of output is accurate (e.g. supply shocks, estimating output without disinflation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credibility and Reputation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying is one thing and the electability of policymakers can get in the way of keeping promises. Central banks are usually independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;price controls likely to cause shortages since in a free market, relative prices will change due to supply and demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortages due to excess demand cause disruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the disruptions imply that the controls are temporary and public will expect greater inflation in the future&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money supply is also affected by the banking system’s behaviour and the public’s decisions, not just the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depository institutions: privately owned banks, trust companies, credit unions, and &lt;em&gt;caisses populaires&lt;/em&gt; (Quebec) that accept deposits from and make loans directly to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First supply of money is deployed in exchange of real assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The belief that money has value becomes self-justifying: If most people believe that money has value, then it has value.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if everyone believes money has no value then no one would accept it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convincing the public by declaring money as &lt;strong&gt;legal tender&lt;/strong&gt;: creditors must accept the money as settlement of debts and can pay taxes in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money is a liability on central banks&amp;rsquo;  balance sheet and it is the &lt;strong&gt;monetary base&lt;/strong&gt; or high-powered money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fractional-reserve-banking&#34; &gt;Fractional Reserve Banking

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money held as bank deposits instead of currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bank reserves&lt;/strong&gt;: liquid assets available for withdrawal and paying cheques drawn on depositor&amp;rsquo; accounts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% reserve: profit earned from negative interest rates (fee for deposit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partial reserve: not all currency is being used, some amount is being untouched. Therefore can lend it out to earn interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reserve-deposit ratio&lt;/strong&gt;: reserves divided by deposit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fractional reserve banking&lt;/strong&gt;: reserve-deposit ratio is less than 100% (one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since a loan ends up being deposited again, the bank will keep loaning out money
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the reserves amount never changes, the deposits will keep going up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the money supply balloons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money supply = monetary base / desired reserve ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;when more depositors want to withdraw than the bank has money available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from a depositors&amp;rsquo; perspective, withdrawal avoided the risk of collapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banks would need to convince customers that everything is fine&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;M =((cu + 1) / (cu + res)) BASE
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central bank prints money and buys real assets with the money, thereby increasing the monetary base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central bank can also sell real assets and retire currency (lowers the currency and base)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the money multiplier is constant, the percent change in the monetary base equals the percent change in the money supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since money multiplier is unstable, changes monetary base is used to influence short-term interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created in 1934, crown corporation since 1938&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the government may issue a directive to the Bank, it has not done so since the act was amended in 1967 to allow this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Board: 12 part-time directors, governor (appointed for 7 years renewable by the governor), senior deputy governor, deputy minister of finance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;directors are not experts on monetary policy and cannot be bankers nor economists&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially, although the government has the power to influence the bank, it can&amp;rsquo;t influence in the short-term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance sheet
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Largest asset are government bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owns nearly 20% of outstanding treasury bills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owns loans to other banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes in circulation (January 2023): 119,417,195,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deposits from other banks plus currency at banks equals total reserves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary base = bank reserves plus currency outside banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetary base = total currency outstanding plus bank deposits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks only make net transfers to each other (e.g. National Bank $100 cheque from RBC + RBC $80 cheque from National Bank = $20 to NB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing/Settlement balances&lt;/strong&gt; are held at the Bank of Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reserves are not required to be held at the Bank of Canada, but 13 large banks and credit unions (direct clearers) do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Value Transfer System (LVTS)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Institutions that can clear cheques but don&amp;rsquo;t partake in LVTS have accounts with the larger banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks with larger balances than needed can lend to another bank charging an &lt;strong&gt;overnight rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank of Canada announces on eight preset days (or in unusual circumstances) a 0.5 interest rate band of which the center is the &lt;strong&gt;target overnight rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bank lends at the top range of the band called the &lt;strong&gt;bank rate&lt;/strong&gt; which is a ceiling for the other banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bank pays interest on deposits at the rate given by the bottom edge of the band which places a floor under the overnight rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, banks will only want to lend at a rate higher than this deposit paying rate and will want to borrow only at most the bank rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowering interest rate, increases advances made, which is a credit to deposits, which means the monetary base has expanded&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchasing securities increases the bank&amp;rsquo;s assets and writes a cheque on itself (it&amp;rsquo;s own deposits)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplier effect results in a higher money supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used to affect interest rates as well
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Purchase and Resale Agreements  (SPRAs or repos): buy short-term government securities and sell next day (increase in seller&amp;rsquo;s settlement balance which puts downward pressure on the overnight interest rate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sale and Repurchase Agreements (SRAs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantitative Easing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although most open-market operations are on short-term (3 month), it can buy/sell other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchase and sale of government or non-government securities with long terms to maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once nominal interest rate reaches 0, bank cannot force it down any further, so QE can be used on the other assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates can be long-dated, illiquid, and risky so bank can either
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce rate of return on short-term, liquid, and safe to expect that others will move in same direction (conventional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce rate of long-term, illiquid, and risky by buying and selling those very securities (QE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Discretion
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the central bank should continuously monitor the economy and, using the advice of economic experts, should change the money supply as needed to best achieve its goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposition 1. Monetary policy has powerful short-run effects on the real economy. In the longer run, however, changes in the money supply have their primary effect on the price level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposition 2. Despite the powerful short-run effect of money on the economy, there is little scope for using monetary policy actively to try to smooth business cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time needed to gather and process information (information lag) to determine state of economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncertainty to the magnitude of the effect of a change in interest rates and money supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe a year to take effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bank of canada estimates 12-18 months to influence inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might be possible for wages to adjust quick enough that the monetary supply causes prices to rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposition 3. Even if there is some scope for using monetary policy to smooth business cycles, the central bank cannot be relied on to do so effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distrust of central bank comes from historic examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1929-1933: Federal Reserve System was unable or unwilling to stop the money supply from falling by one-third due to bank runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposition 4. The central bank should choose a specific monetary aggregate (such as M1 or M2) and commit itself to making that aggregate grow at a fixed percentage rate, year in and year out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;central bank has considerable influence over the rate of money growth so it can be held accountable for deviation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;steady money growth would lead to smaller cyclical fluctuations than &amp;ldquo;countercyclical&amp;rdquo; monetary policies used historically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ultimately, the growth rate of the monetary aggregate selected would be consistent with an inflation rate near zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some are open to suspending rules during a depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monetarism relies on the assumption that the government and the central bank are incompetent and can&amp;rsquo;t intervene effectively. The argument against rules is that the central bank has done better post world war II; in other words, monetary policy is getting better. However, the rules argument is not just about incompetence but also about credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose the central bank says they will maintain a stable money supply. If there is no credibility, firms can increase prices because they know the central bank will increase money supply. If there is credibility, firms will realize prices would come down anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase credibility, the central bank has to be willing to let the economy go into a recession if firms doubt the central bank and try messing with short-term output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironclad rules create risks when prevent corrective actions from taking place during unexpected crisis&amp;rsquo; (e.g. depression).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;nominal overnight interest rate = inflation + 0.02 + 0.5 * percent deviation from full-employment output + 0.5 (inflation - 0.02)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where inflation is the trailing twelve months and 0.02 is the target for inflation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described actual behaviour of U.S. Federal Reserve quite accurately. Meant as a guideline. A number of countries have adopted inflation targeting since the 90s. An advantage is that it&amp;rsquo;s simple to understand so households can make decisions. A major disadvantage is that inflation responds to policy with a long lag so the bank has to act 12-18 months early.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada is exploring targeting price level because it provides certainty about long-term purchasing power of money. With inflation targeting being a band of 1-3% per year, investors have to plan for cumulative inflation of 28% to 109% in 25 years. With price-level targeting, the price level fo 164.06 is certain, but the central bank must allow inflation to be variable. If year one has 1% inflation, under inflation targeting, only 2% needs to be hit in the next. Under price-level targeting, a price level of 104.04 is sought and an inflation rate of 3% is tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price level targeting allows greater flexibility. If interest rates are raised to cool housing and inflation falls, there is still commitment that the long-term price-level will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to use Price-Level targeting all comes down to the public&amp;rsquo;s ability to plan and look ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;24.8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue comes from direct and indirect taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue comes from direct (imposed on taxpayer such as personal income taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes such as EI and CPP/QPP) and indirect taxes (25%) where the burden imposed on an entity is passed to another entity (e.g. sales tax, GST, HST).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget break down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good and Services: 1/4 of federal spending and 3/4 for other levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer Payments: Greater proportion in federal than lower tiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest Payments: more important in federal but proportion wise lower-tier pay more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder that surplus = Tax Revenue (T) minus Government purchases (G) minus Transfers (TR) minus interest payments (INT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;primary budget surplus&lt;/strong&gt; excludes interest payments. The importance of this concept is to answer the question on if the government can afford its current programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how does the government spend its resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;current items (police officers) versus capital items (mass transit systems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a current deficit does not include capital spending but does include upkeep (fight against depreciation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net lending = T - (G + TR + INT - dK + I) = saving + dK - I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net lending is usually higher then depreciation so net lending is less than saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surplus that is based on current spending is higher than one that includes investment spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;incentives-and-taxes&#34; &gt;Incentives and Taxes

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If average taxes go up but marginal stays the same, labour goes up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if marginal goes up and average stays the same, less labour is supplied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, to keep people working, need to increase the lowest marginal rates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distortions&lt;/strong&gt;: tax-induced deviations from the efficient free market outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distortions occur because of why people are motivated to work
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems that at the end of the day increasing taxes for average people does more harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As income rises in Canada, benefits fall. The additional dollar may also result in losing the benefit
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High marginal tax rates and low average tax rates discourages labour supply and leads to &lt;strong&gt;poverty trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disposable income does not increase as fast as earned income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it hard to eliminate the poverty trap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It means it costs money to subsidize low-income workers when they enter the labour force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordination from the federal and provincial governments as one is responsible for refundable income tax credits and the other administers social assistance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My solution: federal government should not be directly transferring to individuals but only to provinces. The existence of a transfer to individuals by both the provincial government and a federal government indicates redundant wealth transfers that can be delegated to the provincial government as the federal government&amp;rsquo;s duties are about laws, national defence, and economic guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tax rate smoothing&lt;/strong&gt;: maintaining stable tax rates to minimize distortions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Laffer curve: government revenue is 0 at both 0% and 100% tax rates. At a certain point, an increase in the tax rate causes a decrease in the tax base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a study found that 5 of 10 province corporation tax rates were higher than optimal collection (Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and PEI).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt: total value of government bonds outstanding since bonds are used to finance debt
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net of debt owed to government via financial assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debt-GDP ratio: debt outstanding over GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the budget deficit equals the change in the nominal value of the government bonds outstanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in Debt-GDP ratio = Deficit:GDP + (Interest:GDP - GDP Growth) * Previous Debt:GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change in debt-gdp ratio:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= (G + TR - T) / Y (budget deficit ratio) + (interest rate - growth rate) * (previous debt-GDP ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= deficit ratio divided by the GDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If GDP increase by 2%, then do deficit ratio / (GDP * (1 + 2%))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a view that the billions in debt will need to be paid by children and grand children via taxes so government borrowing robs the future
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caveat: bonds are owned by Citizens therefore future payers of debt are already the ones being the recipients of the interest and principal\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issue 1: higher tax rates and current budget deficits will lead to a distortion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issue 2: most people hold no or little bonds but will be the ones paying higher taxes to pay debt than receiving interest. may have fewer public services
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bond holders are richer on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issue 3: government deficits reduce national saving and thus economy accumulates less domestic capital and foreign assets; lower standard of living for future generations. David Johnson of WLU concluded that debt accumulation from 1975 - 1996 resulted in lower incomes of 3-10%. Cos of $57 to $189B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/files/economics/introductory_essay.pdf&#34;&gt;is the debt war over?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assumption is that the same people paying taxes today will be responsible for paying back the debt that the government accumulated during their life. The argument that the equivalence would hold is that the current generation would save out of the goodness of their hearts to help the next generation BUT it will still appear unfair either in the sense that the next generation earns less and pays more in taxes and thus is looked down upon by the current generation as being too stupid to earn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons it may fail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrowing constraints: many people would consume more if lenders existed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortsightedness: people don&amp;rsquo;t get that they will pay for the government&amp;rsquo;s debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failure to leave bequests: no inheritance because they believe children will be richer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-lump-sum taxes: level and timing of tax cuts have effect on the economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deficit causes higher AD, higher price levels, and lower desired national saving (IS upward)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can lead to ongoing increases in money supply
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;central bank funds the government&amp;rsquo;s borrowing instead of taxes or public borrowing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seigniorage: the revenue governments raise from printing money (only for governments with the right to issue money)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finance department or treasury authorizes borrowing → new bonds are issued → central bank is asked to purchase → new currency issued (monetary base increases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy reliance on seignorage usually occurs in war-torn or developing countries, in which military or social conditions dictate levels of government spending well above what the country can raise in taxes or borrow from the public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened during 2020 in Canada though? Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small differences in growth rates lead to large differences in the average person&amp;rsquo;s income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since 1973, industrialized countries experienced a sustained slowdown; significant slowdown of productivity growth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argument one: no slowdown bu measurement error (failing to measure improved quality of capital inputs - like computers)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my take: probably this since desktops came in 1970s and they only got cheaper and better over time. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to fail to adjust the value of today&amp;rsquo;s computers and electronics to as high as they used to be. Especially as price data is lost and competition is rife. Old technology was measured so high but it&amp;rsquo;s output would be worth $0 today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argument two: large increase in oil prices since the timing and universal effect is there but productivity did not surge back up after oil prices came down
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this did reduce productivity, obviously but by the time prices went up, computers started taking over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one understands completely why economies grow, and no one has a magic formula for inducing rapid growth. Indeed, if such a formula existed, there would be no poor countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;elasticity of output with respect to labour (alphaN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth accounting equation:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;growth rate of output = growth rate of productivity + alphaK * growth rate of capital + alphaN * growth rate of labour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure of growth need to be adjusted for skilled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using historical data, alphaK = 0.3, alphaN = 0.7&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher labour participation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher national saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;due to diminishing returns, productivity is key for sustained growth&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reaching the steady state
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving t = s (constant) Yt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sYt = (n + d)Kt [steady]
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this constraint fixes the capital-labour ratio unless there is a change in population growth, saving rate, or productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since population growth cannot keep increasing, in the long-run only productivity growth increases per-capita growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sAf(k) = (n + d)k [steady]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually below the golden rule steady state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in productivity: increases output, incomes, saving, capital stock; y = Af(k) curve &lt;strong&gt;shifts up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;living standards: output, consumption, and capital per worker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher saving rate: higher long-run output due to larger capital sock ( sAf(k) curve shifts up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase in population growth rate: causes long-run output to fall since more output is used to equip workers with capital rather than for consumption; (n+d)k curve shifts up&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;human capital: invest in people and thus productivity increases and if &lt;strong&gt;physical capital and human capital are correlated&lt;/strong&gt;, then marginal productivity of capital does not need to diminish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R&amp;amp;D generates technical know-how which is productive and offsets capital productivity declining&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affecting the savings rate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there is no discrimination against individuals spending or saving, savings rate freely chosen should be optimal in balancing short-term pain for long-term gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canadians save too little and policy should raise saving rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if real interest rate affects saving, hen a tax change that increased the real return would work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taxing consumption and not income; too small of a response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;require people to save (e.g. CPP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government saving, but can deficit spending on infrastructure work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;savings rate can automatically increase if disposable income increases due to a non-zero marginal propensity to save
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducing income tax rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lowering cost of necessities like shelter, food, clothing, transportation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shelter costs can be reduced by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting red tape on new housing construction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting taxes on new housing construction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expanding zoning to allow mixed-use constructions that allow small businesses owners to live above their small business which would increase the money reinvested into the business by allowing the owner to temporarily pay themselves a lower wage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;democracy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relative to dictatorships: less wars, better relations, pro-investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic growth?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India (democracy) vs. China (one-party)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenny A. Minier: used control groups and compared countries that transitioned from/to democracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affecting productivity rates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quality of nation&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and productivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highways, bridges, utilities, dams, airports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has to complement activities of the private sector
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. lowering transportation costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public–private partnerships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human capital and productivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;education, worker training/relocation, health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific programs should be examined carefully to see whether benefits exceed costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;entrepreneurial skill&lt;/strong&gt;: building successful new business or new products tto market
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove unnecessary barriers to entrepreneurial activity (excessive red tape)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;research and development
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;research councils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scientific and technical progress, even commercially oriented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government does 25% of R&amp;amp;D spending which has fallen since 1963 (worst in G7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government should fund more masters, PhD&amp;rsquo;s, and research rather than rely on tax credits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial policy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;influence countries pattern of industrial development through taxes, subsidies, or regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting investment policies of crown corporations like CPP to invest more in industries or startups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promote high-tech industries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;borrowing constrains: startups can&amp;rsquo;t finance projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spillovers: one company bears cost of the breakthrough while others do the cheaper improvements
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subsidy or patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dangerous since not easy to pick the winning tech and could support political supporters not economic promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market policy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extent of intervention in the markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spectrum between communism and capitalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;possibility of monopolies and oligopolies to emerge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unattractive: medical care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social insurance
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well-designed social net is important for redistributing economic gains and when there is a fallback, greater risk can be taken to strive for growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the misperceptions theory, short-lived shocks may have long-term effects on the economy because of &lt;code&gt;______&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) accelerator effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) automatic stabilizers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) multiplier effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) propagation mechanisms. &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is SRAS &amp;gt; LRAS (Misperceptions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: when actual price level is higher than the expected price level&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for different effects of an anticipated fiscal policy on the full-employment output in the Keynesian and Classical models is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) the Keynesian model assumes rational expectations, but the Classical model assumes perfect insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) the Keynesian model assumes perfect insight, but the Classical model assumes rational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) contrary to the Classical model, the Keynesian model assumes that policy has no wealth effect.  &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) the Keynesian model assumes perfect insight, but the Classical model assumes rational expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Keynesian, there is no wealth effect due to price level adjusting in case of MS policies and expectations theory in case of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrifice Ratio: output lost for each 1% reduction in inflation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hystersis: natural rate of unemployment changes in response to the actual unemployment rate (rises if actual unemployment rate is below natural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;change in debt-gdp ratio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;= (G + TR - T) / Y (budget deficit ratio) + (interest rate - growth rate) * (previous debt-GDP ratio)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;= deficit ratio + (interest:gdp - growth) * previous debt-GDP-ratio
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;= deficit ratio divided by the GDP
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If GDP increase by 2%, then do deficit ratio / (GDP * (1 + 2%))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The per-worker production function in the Solow model assumes &lt;code&gt;______&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) increasing returns to scale and diminishing marginal productivity of capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) constant returns to scale and increasing marginal productivity of capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) constant returns to scale and diminishing marginal productivity of capital. &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) decreasing returns to scale and diminishing marginal productivity of capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s * f(k) = (n + k) k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman-Phelps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unanticpated inflation vs. unemployment at a natural rate of unemployment
requires expected inflation and natural rate are equal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just read that forecasters predict Canada will run a current account deficit in 2004. From this you would infer that Canada will also &lt;code&gt;_______&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) decrease its holding of net foreign assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) run a capital account deficit in 2004.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) run a balance of payments surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) decrease its official reserve assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital account surplus = decrease in net foreign assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following statements is true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) The world as a whole has a current account deficit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) The world as a whole has a balance of payment surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) The world as a whole has a current account balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) The world as a whole has a current account surplus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has a current account deficit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because a current account deficit equals capital account surplus. Therefore, it follows that there is a higher deficit due to this mechanism rather than the offsetting current account surpluses in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is an increase in the future marginal product of capital in a large open economy, it causes the
current account to &lt;code&gt;________&lt;/code&gt; and saving to &lt;code&gt;________&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) fall; remain unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) fall; rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) rise; rise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) rise; remain unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future marginal product of capital increases, then current investments increase, which can borrow locally or at the world rate (current account falls). The higher rates entices saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorption: amount consumed by domestic residents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a temporary adverse supply shock hits a small open economy, it causes the current account to
&lt;code&gt;________&lt;/code&gt; and investment to &lt;code&gt;________&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A) fall; remain unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B) fall; fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C) rise; remain unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D) rise; fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that a decrease in savings corresponds to a decrease in current account and that in a &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; open economy, rates are unaffected change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How a Universal Basic Income Can Improve Innovation and Raise Wages</title>
      <link>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/universal-basic-income/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 01:07:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/universal-basic-income/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often hear about profit and wage complainers. People who think companies are not entitled to any increase in profits and that workers are entitled to wage increases due to a non-casual productivity increase; By this I mean that productivity has outpaced real wages not because the workers got more skillful, but because workers required less skills and abilities due to an efficiency in the technology used by workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we raise worker wages? To raise work wages, we need to increase the demand for skilled labour or lower the supply of labour assuming constant immigration. That is, immigration does not increase to meet the demand for skilled labour. To increase demand for labour, more competition is required; An increase in the number of businesses or an increase in innovation. I won&amp;rsquo;t be proposing a policy designed solely on increasing innovation but I will propose a policy where the side effect is an increase in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to allow people to work on innovation without requiring much initial capital as well as not becoming homeless. An optimal situation is a person who only has to worry about food and utilities. Since these days, people need to pay for shelter, then the country needs to subsidize the cost of shelter at the minimum. Many places offer grants of $10,000, but this does not even cover a whole year&amp;rsquo;s rent in many cities. The only way it could cover rent is if a person shared their shelter with roommates which can be disastrous to someone&amp;rsquo;s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allow for such a scenario, we need to provide a strong social net that would let people do their own thing without worrying about homelessness. The entire point of working is to provide money to spend on leisure. Leisure is a very broad term, but that is essentially the point of work. We need to maximize working to live and minimize living to work. Living to work is when there is little to no leisure in someone&amp;rsquo;s life. They are essentially living their life to work and the only distinction to slavery is that you are choosing not to be homeless&amp;hellip;Which is pathetic since if money didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, no one would be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better social net would increase competition, lower homelessness, but would need funding. I liked what this one guy said; Only one social safety policy for everyone. No exceptions. No pension plan, no disability, only a monthly stipend that can cover housing in the 10th affordable city to live in. I also suggest that anyone who would receive this stipend be barred from investing in securities such as publicly traded shares and fixed income securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation&#34; &gt;Innovation
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#innovation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve innovation, we need research and development; plain and simple. We can go about it two ways. Incentivize R&amp;amp;D and reward successful R&amp;amp;D. R&amp;amp;D is already an expense, so only a tax credit would actually incentivize performing more R&amp;amp;D. That&amp;rsquo;s alright for societies that don&amp;rsquo;t depend on tax revenues. Rewarding successful R&amp;amp;D is done via patents. However, patents themselves can stifle innovation. Therefore, we need to rework patent laws. As in patents can only be valid for 5 years or if we wanted to make it 20 years, that after 5 years they can only be enforced by owners if the patent&amp;rsquo;s tech could be actively purchased for a year. This defeats patent trolls first and foremost, ensures that innovations can be chained quickly (software has proven innovation can chain in short periods of time, so any hindrance/reward for innovation should take into account this concept of chaining). The thing with patents is that the holder gets an effective monopoly so we need to be careful in their profits. If the patent is truly an innovation, then the free market would price it accordingly. No good or service can simultaneously be out of reach and make the substitute obsolete. To make something obsolete, one would have to price goods fairly until competitors are unable to make profits, but that 5 years period exists for a reason. If we take shorter expiry dates, then by the time the patent expires, competitors are able to also make profits. The original company has to be constantly innovating to stay ahead of the game. If we take the longer patent expiry scenario, competitors may go bankrupt, so would most likely merge and form their own monopoly to lower costs further of their obsolete good (economies of scale) or can now have the means to pursue R&amp;amp;D initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose though that the substitute good has gone obsolete. How will consumers be protected for the next 15 years? Well now we really need to think hard. I forget what the concept is called in contract law, but essentially, if one party has been paying more than the required amount to the other party, that new amount becomes the defacto terms of the agreement. Governments can apply the same concept to price increase of goods (max price increase % = average price increase minus inflation for the past 5 years + current inflation). This is a good policy in my opinion, since revenue and profits are not capped, only same product price &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; is capped higher than inflation. Which means that a company that successfully innovates, can make profits for 20 years without worry about inflation and without severely hurting consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible rebuttal is what if consumer real wages aren&amp;rsquo;t increasing high enough? Well consumer real wages have been increasing on average of 2%. Considering that patented goods are not a considerable chunk of a consumers expenditures, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a point since life necessities arne&amp;rsquo;t really patented. Another rebuttal someone might bring up is drug pricing. Well, unless the drug is new, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why companies that innovate drugs/medicine shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed to make a profit. If pharmaceutical companies are basically making so much money off their innovations that they are monopolizing the entire industry, then the patent law can obviously be modified. And if we see a reduction in drug innovation, then obviously we need to go about this the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pharmaceutical&#34; &gt;Pharmaceutical
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pharmaceutical&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of price gouging of innovation, we really need to decide if society needs to innovate further, with relation to drugs. I believe that most drugs being developed and sold at high prices affects those with serious diseases they were probably born with and are extremely rare. Since the number of beneficiaries are low, the company has to price accordingly. If a drug costed $50m to make and there are only 400 people that need it, yeah $125,000/person on only the R&amp;amp;D cost and not continued operations. Governments really need to decide who&amp;rsquo;s health to prioritize, and since governments are a democracy, there will always be someone left out. Considering that companies still pursue the development of these drugs without government subsidies is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the goal of the government is to maximize the lives of its own residents, then the budget for these rare scenarios will have to small enough that the main point of the tax benefits the most tax payers. People don&amp;rsquo;t pay taxes to benefit people, they pay it as a collective so that everyone benefits collectively as some things are much easier to acquire in bulk or as a collective than individually; fire departments, insurance, police, roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;real-life&#34; &gt;Real Life

    &lt;a href=&#34;#real-life&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, we can look at the USA. The USA has done a lot with regard to &amp;ldquo;UBI&amp;rdquo; by letting the free markets do it themselves. For example, Stanford gives its phd students a free ride. This was instrumental in forming Google. The USA is merit based UBI. Only those with merit are allowed to get funding by those already in power. Another notable example is Nikola Tesla. He came to USA with nothing, but people like Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse helped him out to survive and continue his focus on innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also see this all the time in terms of generational scaling. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A country can either rely on pure luck for competition to grow their country&amp;rsquo;s wages or can take proactive steps to ensure that resources are being allocated as best as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dumping my notes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MR = P_e (1 + 1/η)
η = dQ/dP * P_e/Q_e&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price is elastic when 0 &amp;lt;= Q &amp;lt; a/2b where a and b are coefficients of the demand function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INPUT MAXIMIZATION
MR / Product of input a = Marginal Expenditure of input a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MP_L / P_L = MP_K / P_K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticity of output for Cobb-Douglas equals the exponent of the respective input
E.g.
Q_1 = 100 * L^0.7 * K^0.4
increase labour by 1%: Q_2 = 100(1.01L)^0.7 * K^0.4
Q_2 = 1.006989(100L^0.7 * K^0.4)
Q_2 ~= 1.007Q -&amp;gt; 0.7% increase (exponent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies of Scope
When it is cheaper to produce quantities of two products together
How much is saved as a percentage of the new cost
(OLD COST - NEW COST) / NEW COST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PC, profit maximizing level is when P = MC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;markup equal to −1/(1 + η)
markup % = P / MC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in fixed proportions, MC = MR_A + MR_B as long as either MR is &amp;gt; 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cournot solution
Set dProfit/dQ_a/b = 0 for both companies where Q_a/b is the respective Quantity for each company (e.g. TR_a = XQ_A + m(Q_a + Q_b)Q_a )
Substitute equations and voila
Price leader
Using the Q_b = &amp;hellip; equation, sub into P= equation
e.g.  Q = Q_a + Q_b where Q_b is the substituted equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising expenditures are optimal if an additional dollar spent on ads
increases net profit (NOT MR) by one dollar.
MR from $1 of advertising should equal elasticity of demand curve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Discrimination Optimal
MR_1 = MR_2
P_1(1 + 1 / ped_1) = P_2(1 + 1 / ped_2)
P_1 / P_2 = [1 + (1 / ped_2)] / [1 + (1 / ped_1)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First degree
Charging at demand curve
Second degree
By usage. Less/q as q increases
Third degree
Discounting distinct separable markets
set MR_1 = MC = MR_2
Peak load pricing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing Strategy (Coupons)
MR_R = MR_S = MC
P(1 + 1 / PED_R) = (P - X)(1 + 1 / PED_S)= MC.
X is discount value
PED_R for those who don&amp;rsquo;t use coupons.
PED_S for those who use coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two part tariff
Entry fee = consumer surplus where P = MC
Per use fee found by P = MC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit = R - Fixed Costs - Dis-utility of Manager as $&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calculating utility with probabilities, first calculate utility of all wealths
and then multiply by the probabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there are big firms and small firms,
set MC_i = P to first find q_i and then * by # to get Q_small
Then do Q - Q_small to get Q_big which you can use to find P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;variance = weight * (val_1 - weighted_mean)^2 + &amp;hellip;
std_dev = sqrt(variance)&lt;/p&gt;
