I added authors support just for this guy. I attended his talk at WLU and wrote some notes and wanted to give credit sometime in the future.

- [Improving Safety and Efficiency of Payment System using AI and Quantum Computing](/posts/talks/improving-payments-with-ai-ajit-desai/)

These author pages will also work well for my book notes like [Flash Boys](/posts/literary-analysis/flash-boys-a-wall-street-revolt-michael-lewis/) and [Thinking, Fast and Slow](/posts/literary-analysis/thinking-fast-and-slow-daniel-kahneman/). The future of course, took 8 months, but I've added (or figured out) how to show authors.

Ajit Desai is a data scientist at the Bank of Canada (at least at the time of the talk and as of 2025-1-12).
