This document are my notes and midterm review for the BU 375 Operations course taught at Wilfrid Laurier University. While studying for the midterm, I discovered my own formulae shortcuts, undoubtedly due to "blind teaching syndrome" (I made that term up).
So let's begin. I'll add a divider to let you know what is part of the midterm.

## Appendix

It's better to have the appendix at the top rather than the bottom, so that people know where to get the values for some examples.

### Control Factors

Out with the ugly table, and in with the new!
It's absurd that at $500+ per course and hundreds of students, universities do not collaborate with each other to make course curriculum/content, do not strive for perfect function (notes) and rarely place importance on aesthetics.

### Cost of Quality

Total = cost of achieving good quality + cost of poor quality

#### Good

- Prevetion
- Appraisal/Measuring

#### Poor

- Internal failure
- External failure

#### Quality Index (QI)

Measures quality cost against a base value (e.g. manufacturing, sales, labor hours, quantity)

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QI=\frac{Total\,\,Cost\,\,of\,\,Quality}{Base}\times 100">

## Productivity

### Single-Factor Productivity

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{Specific\,\,Input}">

where Specific Input could be Labor, Materials, Capital.

### Total Factor Productivity

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{Output}{All\,\,Inputs}">

To calculate multi-factor productivity, use a subset of inputs.

### Yield

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)\times(%good)+(1-%good)(%reworked)">

OR

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Yield=(Initial\,\,Quantity)(%{good}_1)...(%{good}_n)">

### Product Cost

For this one, I have my own simplified formulas.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Product\,\,Cost=\frac{(mfg\,\,cost)+(rework\,\,cost)(1-%good)(%reworked)}{%good\times(1-%good)(%reworked)}">

This avoids calculating how many units were reworked.

### Quality Productivity Ratio (QPR)

Even for this one, I have my own method, but I'll include the original in case some information isn't given.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{% good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(1-%good)(%reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?QPR=\frac{good}{(input)(processing\,\,cost)+(reworked)(rework\,\,cost)}">

## Statistical Analysis

- A type I Alpha error is an error that wasn't supposed to fall outside the control limits. False-positive.
- A type II Beta error is an error that should've fallen outside the control limits.
- Variations are either random or assignable.
- `n` refers to sample size or number of observations, and `k` refers to the number of samples.
- `z` refers to the sigma count; either 2 or 3
- UCL and LCL stand for upper control limit and lower control limit.

### p-chart

A p-chart is a control limit chart with relation to the proportion of defects. It is used when there are multiple observations per sample and defects are reported.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar p=\frac{total\,\,defects}{nk}">
<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_p=\sqrt{\frac{\bar p(1-\bar p)}{n}}">
<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar p+z\sigma_p, LCL=\bar p-z\sigma_p">

### c-chart

Similar to p-chart, except there is only 1 observation per sample.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar c=\frac{total\,\,defects}{k}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_c=\sqrt{\bar c}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar c+2\sigma_c, LCL=\bar c-2\sigma_c">

### x-chart

A chart used for checking if process variability is in control.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar{\bar x}=grand\,\,mean = mean\,\,of\,\,means">

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_x=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar{\bar x}+z\sigma_x, LCL=\bar{\bar x}-z\sigma_x">

<!-- Ctrl + F sigma -->

In the case σ is unknown, use the control factors table along with these formulas:

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=\bar{\bar x}+A_2\bar R, LCL=\bar{\bar x}-A_2\bar R">

### R-chart

A range chart, to test if variability is in control. Use the control factors table to determine factor values or to help you figure out other factor values.

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bar R=average\,\,range">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?UCL=D_4{\bar R}, LCL=D_3\bar R">

### Reliability

To improve reliability,

- reduce number of components in a series
- increase backup components
- increase individual component reliability

To calculate the reliability of a process, use these two functions.

#### Series

For components in a series (independents), multiply their reliability scores:

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_1x_2x_3">

#### Parallel (Backups)

For components that are in parallel (i.e. backups exist), follow this schema,

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_1+(1-x_1)x_2+(1-x_1)(1-x_2)x_3">

#### System Availability

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?SA=\frac{mean\,\,time\,\,between\,\,failures}{MTBF+mean\,\,repair\,\,time}">

### Process Capability Index

When design mean and process mean are the same use c<sub>p</sub>, otherwise c<sub>pk</sub>.

If c<sub>p</sub> and c<sub>pk</sub> are >= 1, then the process is capable (99.70%).
If c<sub>p</sub> = c<sub>pk</sub>, then design mean and process mean are the same.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c_p=\frac{upper\,\,limit-lower\,\,limit}{6\sigma}">

I tweaked the formula for c<sub>pk</sub>. Instead of dividing both numbers by 3σ, divide only the min.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c_{pk}=\frac{\min\{{upper\,\,limit-process\,\,mean,process\,\,mean-lower\,\,limit}\}}{3\sigma}">

The number chosen also represents which limit the process (mean) deviated towards.

## Server Model

- Poisson distribution
- First in First Out (FIFO)
- Infinite population because people served can re-join the queue

The lambda variable refers to mean arrival rate and the mu variable refers to mean service rate.

## Supply Chain Management Strategy & Design

- Chain of organizations and facilities, with varying activities
- Multi-tiered
- Activities
  - forecasting, purchasing, product/process design, manufacturing, quality assurance, inventory management, distribution

### Supply Chain Process

1. **Procurement** of **raw materials** and services
2. **Production** of **product** and services
3. **Storage** of products in **inventory**
4. Taking orders and **distribution** of products to the customer

### Supply Chain for Service Providers

- Focuses on human resources
- Fewer tiers

### Supply Chain Management (SCM)

- Create maximum value for the end customer
- perfecting coordination and collaboration of components
- To provide enough supply at the right price, time, and place
- Systemic approach to manage entire flow of information, materials, and services from raw-materials to customers
- Competition becomes between supply chains rather than companies

#### Bullwhip Effect

- Supply chain members farther down the line get information after the members
nearer to customers.
- importance of transparency across members
- Safety stock issues
- Lack of accurate demand information
- Order batching results in less orders but larger quantities
- Price fluctuations
- Shortage gaming (placing orders more than is required bc inventory is short supply)
- **Solutions**
  - Coordination by parties for pricing, transportation, and inventory management
  - Joint demand information forecast
  - Price stabilization
  - Discouraging shortage gaming

I believe a solution is for the supplier to force the orderer to
tell them when the next order will be. That way, a supplier won't have to decide
whether to anticipate more orders if batch ordering occurs.

### Supply Chain Uncertainty

- Inaccurate demand forecasting
- Long and Varying times for orders
- Late/Incomplete shipments
- Product changes and price fluctuations/discounts
- Batch ordering and inflated orders
- Failures cause chain reactions, leading to lag, lack of supply, and lower sales
- Inventory is used as insurance against uncertainty, however optimality needs to be determined

### Supply Chain Coordination and Integration

- Sharing information
- Coordinated workflow, production, and operations, procurement
- Adopt new business models and tech
- Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, Replenishment (CPFR)
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

### Information Technology

- E-Business
- Electronic data interchange (EDI)
- Barcode and point-of-sale (POS) data
- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
- Internet
- Blockchain

### Supply Chain Performance

- inventory turnover
- weeks of supply

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Inventory\,\,Turnover=\frac{cost\,\,of\,\,goods\,\,sold}{average\,\,aggregate\,\,value\,\,of\,\,inventory}">

Average aggregate inventory value is the sum of average inventory times value for each item.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Days\,\,of\,\,Supply=\frac{opDays=365}{Inventory\,\,Turnover}">

Fill Rate = fraction of orders filled within a specific time period.

- low inventory turnover indicates that a large amount of inventory is required to satisfy demand

### SCOR Model

- Plan
- Source
- Make
- Deliver
- Enable
- Return

## Project Management

A project is one-time and non-repetitive operational activities or efforts. Clear goal, limited time frame,
budget, schedule, resources.

### Project Elements

1. Objective
2. Scope
3. Contract requirements
4. Schedules
5. Resources
6. Personnel
7. Control
8. Risk and problem analysis

### Project Manager

- plans, schedules, executes, controls project
- meeting requirements
- keeps project on track, within budget, and meets quality standards
- makes trade-off decisions
- expedites work when needed
- resolves conflicts
- adapts

### Project Management Process

- Planning
- Scheduling
- Control

### Work Breakdown Structure

1. Identify **major components** of the project
2. Break down the major components into **sub-components**
3. Break down sub-components into **work packages**

### Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)

- Organizational breakdown structure (OBS) shows which organizational units are responsible for work items
used to develop RAM

### Gantt Chart

- A visual aid for scheduling and control purposes

### CPM & PERT

- Critical Path Method (CPM) has deterministic task times
- Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) has probabilistic task times
- network path: starting node to finishing node sequence
- critical path: longest network path; determines project duration
- critical activities: activities on the critical path
- slack time: allowable slippage for a path

To calculate expected time of a single activity, use

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t_E=\frac{a + 4m + b}{6}">

Where `a` is best case time, `m` is most likely, and `b` is worst case time.

Thus the expected duration of a path (t_path) is the sum of activity expected times.

The variance of each activity time is <img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma^2=(\frac{b - a}{6})^2">

The variance of a path is then the sum of activity variances, and the variance of the *critical* path is also known
as the project variance.

Like always, the standard deviation of anything is the square root of the variance.

As for calculation probabilities, the probability of completing a project by a certain time isw

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?z=\frac{deadline - t_path}{\sigma}">

Use z-table to get a probability representing p(x < deadline) where sigma is the std of the critical path.

To calculate the deadline given a probability, use the z-table to get a z value, and then use the z formula to calculate.

### Crashing

With CPM and PERT some activities can be crashed. For crashing to have an effect on the project duration, the crashes
must reduce the time of the critical path or paths. A single crash might not have an affect on the project duration if there
was an equivalent critical path that didn't need that activity.

Crashing information is stated as cost to crash completely (additional cost) as well as how many weeks can be crashed. Thus,
implicitly, activities can be crashed by a single week rather than the entire allowable crash time.

## Demand Forecasting

Projections of demand for products/services underlies strategic planning when it comes to plant or service
design.

- often inaccurate
- forecasts of similar goods is more accurate than individual items
- forecast horizons increases uncertainty

### Decision Based on Forecasts

- Production and Operations
  - aggregate planning
  - inventory control
  - scheduling
- Finance
  - plant/equipment investment
  - budgetary planning
- Marketing
  - new product introduction
  - sales-force allocation
  - promotions
- Human Resources
  - workforce planning
  - hiring, layoff

### Making Forecasts Useful

- long enough to make it relevant
  - typically for daily, weekly, or monthly sales demand for up to approximately two
  years into the future, depending on the company and the type of industry.
- limitations on accuracy must be clearly stated
- forecasting method should be reliable
- operations forecasts should be expressed in units

### Quantitative Forecasting Methods

- Time-Series methods
  - use historical data to project into the future
  - naive method, moving average, weighted moving average, exponential smoothing
- Associative models
  - independent casual variables

#### Naive Method

Assumes the demand for the next period will be the same as the previous period

#### Moving Average

As the MA-window increases, so too will the lag.

For MA-2, do

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_t=MA_t=\frac{D_{t-1}+D_{t-2}}{2}">

#### Weighted Moving Average

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_t=WMA_t=\sum_{i \in periods} w_i \times D_i">

#### Exponential Smoothing

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_t=\alpha D_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)F_{t-1}">

#### Adjusted Exponential Smoothing

Incorporates a trend factor on top of exponential smoothing

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_{a_t}=F_t+T_t">

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?T_t=\beta(F_t-F_{t-1})+(1-\beta)T_{t-1}">

Where beta is a smoothing constant for the overall trend

Example

For the data given below, generate a forecast using adjusted exponential smoothing.
Assume alpha = 0.5 and beta = 0.3.

An adjusted exponential smoothing forecast requires T<sub>2</sub> to start the computational process.
For this case, assume T<sub>2</sub> = 0.

Period | Month  | Demand | Forecast F<sub>t</sub> | Trend T<sub>i</sub>   | Adjusted Forecast AF<sub>t</sub>
------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------
1      | JAN    | 37     | 37.00                  | -                     | -
2      | FEB    | 40     | 37.00                  | 0                     | 37.00
3      | MAR    | 41     | 38.50                  | 0.45                  | 38.95
4      | APR    | 37     | 39.75                  | 0.69                  | 40.44
5      | MAY    | 45     | 38.37                  | 0.07                  | 38.44

Sample calculation

F<sub>3</sub> = alpha(D<sub>2</sub>) + (1 - alpha) F<sub>2</sub> = 38.5

T<sub>3</sub> = Beta(F<sub>3</sub> - F<sub>2</sub>) + T<sub>2</sub>(1 - Beta) = 0.45

AF<sub>3</sub> = F<sub>3</sub> + T<sub>3</sub>

#### Seasonal Adjustments

Course specific: seasonal adjustment factor (S<sub>q</sub>) relative to
the total demand for some period. Use factor after a forecast to get each quarter's demand forecast.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?S_q=\frac{D_q}{\sum D}">

#### Forecast Accuracy

e<sub>t</sub> = D<sub>t</sub> - F<sub>t</sub>

MAD = sum of | e<sub>t</sub> | / n

mean squared error = sum (e_t^2) / n

mean absolute percentage deviation = sum (e_t) / sum (D_t)

## Inventory Management

### What is Inventory?

- raw materials
- work in progress
- finished products
- packaging
- replacement parts
- goods-in-transit

Important because assets are tied up in inventory. Too much inventory can increase costs
and reduce efficiency while too

### Inventory Control Systems

#### Continuous System

- economic \[fixed] order quantity (EOQ) whenever the reorder point is reached
- inventory is continually monitored (costly)

#### Periodic System

- orders are placed on a fixed time interval
- order quantity = desired inventory level - inventory on hand
- less level of control

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

- single product
- constant annual demand is known
- single delivery with constant lead time smaller than the order cycle
- no discounts

Average inventory = Q / 2

Average inventory cost = Q / 2 * C<sub>c</sub> \[holding cost per unit]

Purchase orders per year = D / Q

Annual order costs = D / Q * C<sub>O</sub>

TC = Q/2 \* C<sub>c</sub> + D/Q \* C<sub>O</sub> = Holding Cost + Ordering cost

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?EOQ = Q_{opt}=\sqrt{\frac{2DC_O}{C_C}}">

Slope = dTC / dQ = C<sub>C</sub>/2 - DC_<sub>O</sub> / Q<sup>2</sup> = 0

#### Quantity Discounts

Add PD to total cost where price is per unit and D is demand.

If quantity is feasible done, otherwise compare with the minimum for each
proce discount level larger than EOQ.

### Economic Production Quantity

Receive quantity incremetally while inventory is being depleted.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?EPQ = Q_{opt} = EOQ * \sqrt{\frac{p}{p-d}}">

Where p is the production rate per day and d is the demand rate per day.

Inventory max = (Q/p)(p-d)

TC = I/2 * C<sub>c</sub> + D/Q * C<sub>S</sub> = Holding Cost + Setup cost per run

### Reorder Point (Constant Demand)

Ensure that the time unit is the same.

### Reorder Point (Variable Demand)

R = demand rate \* lead time + Safety Stock

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?z\sigma_d\sqrt{L}">

Use table for z depending on % service level. e.g. 95% &rarr; z = 1.65. Service level is the probability that demand won't be greater than quantity of goods in stock.

### Periodic Order Quantities (Variable Demand)

Q = average demand rate \* (time between orders + lead time) + z sigma (sqrt (t + L)) - I

### Single Period Inventory Model

Shortage Costs = revenue per unit - cost per unit

Excess Costs = cost per unit - salvage value

SL = C_S / (C_E + C_S) (round up to closest cumulative probability in table)
