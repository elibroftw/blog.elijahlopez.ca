Textbook #1: Behavioural Finance, Psychology, Decision-Making, and Markets, Ackert & Deaves, South-Western Cengage Learning 2018 (available through the libraryâ€™s DTA program)

Textbook #2: Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, Random House, 2013

Suggested additional reading: The Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel

Prospect theory: system I (unconscious, impulsive) vs system II

E.g. driving = System I

Thinking about things is system II

Risk Profiler

are the questions valid or not?

Seagram story

one of the offsprings ran it into the ground

Need discipline when picking people (from fast and slow)

Testable cases: Enronn (2), seagram, risk profiling, Shattered Sears

Marshmallow study: children taking one marshmallow now or waiting five minutes to get two. Study flawed because it only focused on stanford kids (affluence) and wasn't transferable when looking at kids who are less affluent. Ability to postpone gratification at an early age led to more successful life.

James Flynn effect: IQ scores been rising without known effect.

## Chapter 1 Expected Utility Theory

We seek to maximize our consumption utility. Imperfect measurements. Tradeoff is cost ($ and time). Rational. Self-aware.

Prospect theory

- people make decisions based on how they **perceive** trade-offs
  - perceive: humane element; emotional, rational, instincts
  - Question: what is the mind behind a collector
- **Loss aversion**: fear losses more than gains
  - Gains have to significantly outweigh the losses to incentivize humans
  - Investments have to be marketed
- Cognitive limitations
  - People making weird decisions because they are ignorant
- Bounded Rationality
  - you don't know what you don't know
  - bounded to your knowledge and experience
  - often in the case of investments
  - not daily job
  - mortgage timelines

How do we personally evaluate risk, rewards, preferences, and utility. Bias: emotional and cognitive bias. Requires high self-regulation, self-reflection, and humility.

- Emotional
  - want to moderate these
- Cognitive
  - Bounded Rationality
  - Using Heuristics (everyone says so, commonly accepted)

Lamay got people to consume and move away from the buy once use forever mindset.

Cognitive Dissonance

- Anything contrary to your belief is disregarded
- Halo effect on someone

Decision Making Process

- Consumer behaviour and investment behaviour is similar for people without training
- need better frameworks
- Pros vs Cons
- Impulse, lack of time

Traditional finance

- rational assumption: people still not doing things good for themselves
- efficient at obtaining the right information: is the information really readily accessible and do they know it's relevant
- unbiased
- Requires discreteness, indifference curves, transitivity
  - indifference curve optimally is the biggest slope tangent to the curve
- Bayes Theorem
  - `P(expected given I)  =P(E) * P(I given E) / P(I)`
    - bayes updates probability given new information
- Rational Economic Man
  - Challenges: humans affected by many emotions

Behavioural finance

- people are normal (may exhibit flaws)
- people relying on others
  - tulips crisis
  - genetic mutations that were rare
- challenges efficient market hypothesis
- based on observed investor and market behaviour
- macro (herd, society, bubble)
  - functional of policy, incentives (e.g. Soviet Union using tonnage of the shipped for compensation instead of quality)
  - worst examples used
- micro


### Attitude Towards Risk

- Traditional: risk averse and curve is upward sloping and diminishing
- Behavioural: risk evaluation is reference dependent. Risk seeking for some level of wealth (e.g. lottery)
- double inflection: utility function
- move from risk averse to risk seeking at different income levels

### Neuroeconomics

- neuroscience and brain imagery
- psychology
- economics
- _Emotiv_ company

### Bounded Rationality

- Herbert Simon
- Good enough is what we aim for (satisfice)
- We all use heuristics (to save time, hack the problem, but is complacency)
- Time bounded rationality governing

### Bernoulli

- father of decision making
- contradiction of systemic bias and expected value notion in 1738
- proposed utility function &rarr; people want highest utility
- bias towards value

### About Biases

- Most systematic errors are from biases
- Emotional and cognitive biases

### System 1

- automatic
- skillful system 1 through training, experience, and tacit knowledge
- thinking takes a lot of effort, our brains conserve energy by relying on short cuts such as heuristics - can lead to biases (e.g. confirmation bias, anchoring, halo effect, priming, availability, sunk cost fallacy, loss aversion)

### System 2

- contemplative decision making
- more holistic, somewhat self-aware
- new, unfamiliar, complicated
- can still be influenced by biases; e.g. bounded rationality pushing us to seek shortcuts

### Certainty over Uncertainty

- inconsistent risk taking choices
- nature of uncertainty and situation can change risk seeking or averse behaviour

### Prospect Theory

- Different way to look at utility
- Loss aversion (gain and loss not the same)
- Framing of risks has an impact
- miscalculation of risk to reward due to the framework used
- framing
- manipulation of people
- common outcomes (bias)
- Allais paradox
  - good loss aversion question: lose 100% change to lose $750 or 75% chance to lose $1000 and 25% change to lose nothing.
- reference (expectations) changes behaviour
- _hedonic editing_: framing losses and gains as differently

### Ridging Finance Scandal

- Limited partnership
- Couple that worked for ridging finance
- Create their own private lending firm
- Securitized or funded the loan and sold it to Bay St.

### Morbidity vs Mortality

Higher probability to be financially hurt from being disabled than family is from death. Therefore, probably best to purchase disability insurance instead of life insurance.

### Endowment Effect

- owning something gives it more value than not owning it
- somewhat like sunk-cost fallacy
- house money effect: putting away initial capital and gambling with the "wins"
- mental accounting / portfolio layering

## Week 3

### Cognitive Error

- Stat, info processing or memory errors
- Faulty reasoning
- Can be corrected through education
- Dissonance - ignore new info
- Conservatism - prior view
- Confirmation Bias - info confirms beliefs
- Representativeness - classify new info based on past
- Illusion of control
  - belief that they are in control
  - gambling mentality - overtrading
  - risk seeking
- Hindsight - past events predictable
  - selective perception and retention
  - "could have"
- Anchoring & adjustment - heuristics
  - Initial Cost
- Mental accounting - buckets
- Framing - depends on presentation (questions)
- Availability - heuristic, answer related to familiarity

### Emotional Biases

- Feeling or emotive
- Spontaneous
- Less easy to correct
- "Blind spots" of mind
- Regret aversion
- status quo
- endowment
- self-control
  - weighing benefits
  - delay of gratification

### Representativeness Bias

## IPS and Asset Allocation

Investment policy statement: what do you want from the fund and what are the restrictions

1. Types of biases demonstrated
2. Biases that dominate (C or E)
3. Impact on asset allocation
4. What adjustments should be made

### Standard of Living Risk

- Moderate or adapt based on wealth

### BBK Model

- classification models
- confident, impetuous, careful, anxious

## Week 4

### Rolling a Dice

If you get money of the face number you roll of the dice, and you need to pay $3.25, would you do it? If you can re-roll, when do you?

### Mood and Risk Attitude

- studies suggest happier people more optimistic and higher probabilities to positive events

### Disposition Effect

Tendency to hold losers and sell winners.

### Prior Gains and Losses, and RIsk Aversion

- If we don't crystalize a loss, we aren't a loser
- losing a movie ticket vs the money to buy the movie ticket

### House Money Effect

- Successful investment
- Bad investments can caus distress
- If you win at Blackjack and are up $200, do you play more or less aggressively

### Conflicting Effects
