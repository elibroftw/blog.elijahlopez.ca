### Introduction to the Fixed Income Environment

- US: bloomberg real yield
- CA: BNN bloomberg

goldilocks report (happy equilibrium)

Inflation @ 2.8%  wanted to bring it down to 2% but not really possible anymore. Jobs report are strong so can't really do any cuts yet.

Job report and interest rate cuts are very highly connected. 2-yr treasury rate fell to 4.79 when it was over 5 a few months ago.

Fed funds rates (US interbank borrowing rate), 2yr treasury

Dual mandate

Things causing inflation: monetary (demand), non-monetary (supply)

How does the policy discussion reflect the yield curve is market driven

Yield curve: yield vs maturity

Suppose 2-year yield has dropped in anticipation of interest rate cuts.

What is refunding regarding bond auctions:

- government borrowing through issuance of bonds
- refund: refinancing of existing debt
  - issuing debt to buy back older debt that was probably issued at higher rates
- probably higher if investors think that the yield will decrease

Bank of Canada mandate is to promote economic and financial welfare, unlike the Federal Reservers mandate which is both price level and unemployment

ECB: European Central Bank

When there is high inflation, coupons are worth less and the higher interest keeps bond prices lower.

Where to invest in? Treasury 2-4yr, Corporate, Provinces.

Federal Agency Securities: debt taken by government corporations

Secularization: Using loans as collateral to sell something

Money Markets: short-term borrowing using commercial paper...

### Trifecta Framework

- analytics
- intuition
- communication

## Chapter 1

### Markey Players

- Issuers
- Intermediairies
  - Investment banks
  - Commercial banks
  - Dealers
  - Primary Dealers
  - Interdealer brokers
  - Credit rating agencies
- Investors

### Seniority

- Senior secured
- Senior unsecured
- Senior subordinated
- Subordinated
- Junior subordinated

Moodys credit report for recovery rates shows difference between senior secured and senior unsecured and all tranches

### Default Risk

default risk = prob of default \* loss given default = prob of default * (1 - recovery rate)

### Debentures

### Seniority & Capital Structure

### Model AA Toyota Bond Value

Structured instruments

- unlisted for 5 years
- voting rights
- 120% of ordinary shares
- can be bought back at par value
- eligible for set defined dividends

### Dealer Bid Ask Spreads

- Quotes from dealers are dollar plus 1/32nds
- To calculate the bid-ask spread, take all asks and all bids and calculate the difference between the lowest ask and the highest bid
- So if there is an ask of 95 plus 22 and a bid of 95 plus 17, the bid-ask spread is 5/32
- Can infer that there is an implicit ask yield that is lower than the bid yield
- the bid-ask spread is a proxy for (lack of) liquidity

### Prices

- Full price
  - Dirty Price / invoice price
- Actual price
  - Clean price
  - Quoted price (US bond prices quoted on a Bloomberg Terminal)
- Invoice needs to include the interest accrued

To calculate returns, make sure to consistently use the same price. Don't mix up clean and dirty.

### Call Protection Period

- callability is the ability for the issuer to call the bond back
  - usually when interest rates drop, or the firms rating improves
- although the callability itself leads to a premium, call protections is typical for the first half of the bond's life which reduces the flexibility of the firm

### Calling Back a Bond

- Single call date (called in whole)
- Declining call schedule for future years for what price to pay
- Discretely callable schedule (10 days notice)

### Callable versus Refundable

- Refundable bond
  - only refinanced by issuing new debt at lower yields
- Callable bonds can be refinanced by
  - capital injection
  - call option more costly to bond-holders than refundable option

### Make Whole Callable

Special callable bond because it can be exercised at any time, call price is based on the treasury yield at the time the call occurs, the make whole price can go above par value unlike callable which has a ceiling. The make whole provision means that

### Make-whole versus Fixed Call

### Embeded Bond Options

- Favourable to issuers
  - accelerated sinking fund provision:
    - sets a reserve aside to start retiring the debt (further than callable)
  - cap on a floater: max amount of variable rate to pay
  - callable option
  - prepayment option
  - **higher yields and lower prices**
- Favourable to investors
  - puttable option: investor can force the issuer to make the investor whole
  - extendible option: maturity date can be extended
  - conversion option: converted to equity
  - floor on a floater: variable rate but with a guaranteed yield
  - **lower yields and higher prices**

## Overview of the fixed income market

Primary vs Secondary

Issuance vs trading

underwriter has firm commitment

corporate -> prospectus -> dealer (underwriter) -> investors -> buy side (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, trusts)

Dealers (syndicate)

- assesses demand for the debt issue (ratings)
- pricing the issue
- hedging inventory positions
- distributing securities to ultimate investors

## Trustee

- ensures legal requirements are met
- monitors the issuing firm's performance
- takes action

### Indenture

- enforced by trustee
- financial covenants
- restrictive covenants
- underwriter helps

### Why covenants

- lowers cost of debt
- shareholders restrict managers
- bond holders restrict shareholders and managers
- credit sights covenant review

### Corporate Debt Primary Debt
