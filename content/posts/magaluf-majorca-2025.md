If you read my [digital nomad](/posts/digital-nomad) article, you'll know I went with Valencia for my first tour.

## Flights

The second thing to do to lock in is booking a one-way flight. You want to book 2 months in advance, and I want to go in mid-late January. I want to "come back" in September to meet up with family, friends, and to vote (maybe I can do mail-in ballot), but we'll leave that for later because I might want to cut my trip short anyways.

## Accomodation

## Medical Insurance

Need to get this before entering Spain.

## Language

Will try to learn some Spanish. I should dedicate my weekends to learning it.
