Why are pre-construction starts [down](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=1.1.1.8&GeographyId=2270&GeographyTypeId=3&DisplayAs=Table&GeograghyName=Toronto)?

It's because the market clearing price has fallen under the cost to build, and taxes make up 30% of the PURCHASE PRICE.

If LTT becomes the new DC and HST/GST threshold increases to $1M, then the price where a builder is willing to sell can be lowered by 6.8% + 9.1% = 15.9%. Do you not want 15.9% cheaper 2bd/3bd condos? 101 Spadina has sold 28% after almost a year. There is a nice 2bd 2ba unit at $850,000. 84% of it is 714,000, which is cheaper than 2bd condos at the Lincoln in Calgary.
