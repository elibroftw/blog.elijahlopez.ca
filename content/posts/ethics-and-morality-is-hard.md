DISREGARD

## Introduction

Morality and Ethics are simple at their core, but quickly become complicated if you stop and think about it.
In my eyes, morals have to do with impeding someone else's rights and
ethics has to do with decision making that harms others either directly or reasonably indirectly.

For example buying a bit of extra toilet paper during the pandemic is not unethical since you're just buying **a bit** extra.
However, buying several toilet paper package is considered unethical since you are taking away those resources from someone
else who needs it. Just because the free market decides the supply can be purchased, does not mean it is ethical to
purchase the entire supply. This is a failure of the free market, but socialism, communism, marxism, Eli-sm (joke), and etc. are not going to solve unethical behaviour!

We all agree morals and ethics are objective, but time and time again, when applied,
they become **subjective**. So subjective in fact, that we can't agree on which morals are objective!
For the history of the human race, the present society places past societies as immoral;
Colonialism, slavery, marital rape, trading daughters, etc.

Let's take a deep dive on morality. Questioning even the basics.
If our basics are weak, we can never extend them, and future societies will look
down on us! **Gross violations of privacy ring a bell.** However, there's no guarantee
that the society of the future will be more moral than the present. They could look at us
and say we had too much privacy!

Another argument, albeit an easy one, is collateral damage. No innocent human, no matter the
situation at hand, should be killed or harmed significantly! War is against an organization and its supporters. Living
in a country does not mean you support its actions!! It is unreasonable and unethical to

### Murder

If we want to establish basics, the definition of murder does not make sense for "murder is immoral."

According to the two dictionaries [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/murder) and [Oxford](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder), murder is the **crime** of intentionally killing another person.

We can't use cambridge because it does not include premeditated. I don't know about you, but in self-defense,
you are intentionally trying to stop the other person. By the Cambridge definition, a person who killed in self-defense,
would be considered a murderer. Therefore, we will not use its definition.

I implore you to ask yourself what are the flaws of saying "murder is immoral."
So we encounter my first objections for now.

- killing someone when governments and laws (crime is a social construct) don't exist is not considered murder?
- which region's laws? No country can agree on their laws. No country only follows international laws!
- premeditated killing a convicted pedophile is considered murder and thus immoral

To elaborate further, there is a difference between an innocent person being killed and a sober rapist.
If you do not comprehend the difference, you either lack the ability to critically think (in which case read further), or you are not
open-minded.

Innocent: person did not start a violent encounter nor did they call for violence. A person who is verbally abusive is still considered innocent from death.

Sober rapist: I mention sober, because no human has the right to guess if a drunk person actually had the intention of committing rape. The drunk rape should be rightfully punished, but their drinking of alcohol is not a valid death sentence, unless of course it resulted in the death (or worse result) of someone else.
That said, getting drunk is unethical itself. If you're getting shit-faced more than once, you need help!
