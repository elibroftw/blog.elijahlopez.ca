## Introduction

Morality and Ethics are simple at their core, but quickly become complicated if you stop and think about it.
In my eyes, morals have to do with impeding someone else's rights and
ethics has to do with decision making that harms others either directly or reasonably indirectly.
For example buying a bit of extra toilet paper during the pandemic is not unethical since you're just buying **a bit** extra.
However, buying several toilet paper package is considered unethical since you are taking away those resources from someone
else who needs it. Just because the free market decides the supply can be purchased, does not mean it is ethical to
purchase the entire supply. This is a failure of the free market, but socialism, communism, marxism, elism (joke), and etc. are not going to solve unethical behaviour!

We all agree morals and ethics are objective, but time and time again, when applied,
they become **subjective**. So subjective in fact, that we can't agree on which morals are objective!
For the history of the human race, the present society places past societies as immoral;
Collonialism, slavery, marital rape, trading daugthers, etc.

Let's take a deep dive on morality. Questioning even the basics.
If our basics are weak, we can never extend them, and future soceities will look
down on us! **Gross violations of privacy ring a bell.** However, there's no guarantee
that the society of the future will be more moral than the present. They could look at us
and say we had too much privacy!

Another argument, albeit an easy one, is collateral damage. No innocent human, no matter the
situation at hand, should be killed or harmed significantly! War is against an organization and its supporters. Living
in a country does not mean you support its actions!! It is unreasonable and unethical to

## Morals

I believe a strong foundation of morals is required before one starts establishing ethics. One cannot be ethical without moral
but one can be unethical while being moral (toilet paper example). Ambigous decisions and situations are typically marked as unethical.

A very complex example is renting. A landlord that charges its renters the same price as the mortgage + property tax + misc fees is more ethical
than the landlord setting rent higher because of the free market. The latter is taking advantage of people in less fortunate situations!
However, what if I told you that even the first landlord is not ethical enough to be considered a-okay in an ethical world? In an ethical world,
renters should not only be paying cost + a small profit margin, they should also be entitled to % ownership of the home for each month
of mortgage paid. Only when rent = cost free of mortgage payment, does it make sense for renters to not be entitled to ownership! This is
most definitely not only a controversial opinion, but one that no one else has come up with. In fact, I haven't even told my parents of
this idea. It's so beyond the scope of our society that if I was the majority elected prime minister of Canada, I still wouldn't bother implimenting it!

### Murder

If we want to establish basics, the definition of murder does not make sense for "murder is immoral."

According to the two dictionaries [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/murder) and [Oxford](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder), murder is the **crime** of intentionally killing another person.

We can't use cambridge because it does not include premeditated. I don't know about you, but in self-defence,
you are intentionally trying to stop the other person. By the Cambridge definition, a person who killed in self-defence,
would be considered a murderer. Therefore, we will not use its definition.

I implore you to ask yourself what are the flaws of saying "murder is immoral."
So we encounter my first objections for now.

- killing someone when governments and laws (crime is a social construct) don't exist is not considered murder?
- which region's laws? No country can agree on their laws. No country only follows international laws!
- premeditated killing a convicted pedophile is considered murder and thus immoral

To elaborate further, there is a difference between an innocent person being killed and a sober rapist.
If you do not comprehend the difference, you either lack the ability to critically think (in which case read further), or you are not
open-minded.

Innocent: person did not start a violent encounter nor did they call for violence. A person who is verbally abusive is still considered innocent from death.

Sober rapist: I mention sober, because no human has the right to guess if a drunk person actually had the intention of
commiting rape. The drunk rape should be rightfully punished, but their drinking of alcohol is not a valid death sentence, unless
of course it resulted in the death (or worse result) of someone else.
That said, getting drunk is unethical itself. If you're getting shit-faced more than once, you need help!

### Solution

The best way to classify one of the first pillars of morality, is "do not assault others more than they assaulted or were going to assault a human."

I'm not too sure if there is a whole in this, but it covers many cases and is very flexible as intended. Self-defence is not immoral,
but there are things worse than death and those doing those things to another person is immoral and are usually for the rarest cases, if any!
My example is CIA level interrogation of a person involved with the planning of terrorism. The person deserves death for sure, but death
doesn't equate the intention of the terrorist. The flip side, is that the government of the US, shouldn't invade Iraq and destroy civilian buildings in the name of democracy, ~~oil,~~ and anti-terrorism.

Thinking and writing about ethics & morality is not easy. This is as far as I will go for now.

## Ethics

If you think morality is complicated, wait till you see this! Ethics is so complicated, there are guidelines for specilizations!
It is even harder to generalize and make flexible than morality, but it is less severe, meaning we only need to cover most cases
to improve the current system. We need to heavily depend on the spirit of the ethical building blocks, in order to establish
a more ethical society. I had started writing about ethics a year before, so let's see if I can incorporate content from that
abadoned article.
