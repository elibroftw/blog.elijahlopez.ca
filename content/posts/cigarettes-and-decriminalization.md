If the goal of the government is to protect its citizens, it should be taking a more harder stance against products and services that serve a substitutable purpose. Cigarettes are proof that there is a big conspiracy going on that the government bows down to companies that are raking billions of dollars. We know cigarettes cause cancer. We also know psychedelics do not cause cancer. However, the cancer causing product is legally taxed, and psychedelics are available in the grey (BC) or black market.

I strongly suggest governments (Canada) either legalized all drugs and tax them according to their harm level, or to go the full mile and push for annually higher taxes on cigarettes and banning the cigarettes after a decade. This will of course require unbiased studies and research which is absolutely possible.

So what do I think is the right way to go about it? I think people should be able to do whatever they want as long as

1. they were educated on the cons of what they are doing
2. the consumption does not cause direct harm or discomfort to those around them (e.g. smell of cannabis, needles on the ground)
3. the behaviour is deterred through taxes no more than double the sales tax rate

I base this largely off the non-aggression principle (NAP), however the NAP does not usually consider self-harm which I am 100% against or the probability of external-harm which as a realist I want to consider.

We know that we can't just ban all substances that can be abused, because then a black market forms without taxes. Therefore, tax rates must be maximized without a black market forming. Suppliers and buyers must not feel that the legal market is too much of a hassle, while at the same time the tax is deterring people from the inappropriate good or service.

Already, even at a combined sales tax of 13%, cash deals occur in broad daylight. Sales tax is a regressive tax, and the only way a regressive tax makes sense is when it applies to behaviour that is less than the ideal way to live.
