Recently Liberal Leader candidate Mark Carney called the NDP far-left. I disagree with this assertion because far-left can only really be known once you hear the kind of horse shit that is said by them. Here's a few things that makes a person far-left, which in my books is left to a communist. Yes you heard that right, being a commie isn't far left, it's the people who take it further than just believing in a set of core principles. There's a difference between having an opinion on what the best economic system is, versus actively defending foreign regimes that aren't ethical. Look no further than the first reason.

I know the far-left will hate me, but it's important to note that the far-left is the reason leftists can never win. When leftist organizations and party's are overtaken my narrow thinkers, policies like zoning reform and proper wealth (real asset) taxes do not win unless it's a leftist stronghold in an already economically correct region. Two great examples are Austin, TX and Edmonton, Alberta. These cities aren't capable of imposing their ideological negatives like rent-control but do understand they need to build more housing for their residents. In cities like San Francisco, the state is enabling bad behaviour by having rent-control laws. Generally speaking, if most citizens in a city are under rent control, they won't care about zoning reform or building more units. Instead they'lll care about _renovictions_ which is a whack-a-mole game. Even in a province like Ontario, there's renovictions occurring in rent-controlled units. Instead of promoting building more, these cities turn into far-left strongholds and claim that densification / gentrification is bad because poor people will have no where to move (not true), and that builders should not profit off of shelter. So it's okay to profit off of advertising, but putting in work to build a house? That's unethical to the far-left.

## Defending Venezuelan Government for Free

The difference between someone who defends Venezuela for free and someone who is paid to do it is that one is delusional and the other is either lacking in ethics or does not have many economic opportunities to pursue. For example, why do Mexicans want to cross the border into the USA? It's because for the same labour, USA pays more. You put in the same work, get paid more, and thus have greater purchasing power.

A note on illegal immigration. The solution to illegal immigration isn't borders, it's making Mexico an economically independent and strong nation. This means clamping down on corruption, clamping down on crime, and bullying Mexico into becoming a nation of higher integrity. It also means growing Mexico's capital stock. For example, it took the USA until the Civil Rights Act was passed before the police was actually bare minimum good instead of being legalized domestic terrorists.

Far leftists defend Maduro and the election, when a rational human being with some basic math skills in Excel can see that the Maduro government faked the election results. The probability of the vote distribution perfectly fitting nice looking percentages is very low. I have a tweet explaining why.

Also, let's talk sanctions for a second. I don't believe in sanctions. It hurts the global economy and it hurts the people you claim you care about. The USA is sanctioning Venezuela because it's oppressive but it doesn't have an open border policy for Venezuela either. You can't have it both ways. From my perspective, let the people do as well as they can in a global playing field, and if the people want to, they are free to riot against their government. Plenty of countries have done so, Venezuelans are free to do so themselves.

Look at Saudi Arabia, it's also a country I'd call oppressive, but USA has no sanctions against it. It's hypocrisy at its finest, so calling out Venezuela doesn't automatically mean "pro-USA talking points."

## Does not Understand Capital Markets

The other problem with far-leftist is that they think cooperatives are the only way businesses should be structured. They go even further than this and make false claims that cooperatives are illegal. That's not true, capitalism allows for cooperatives but the thing is capital is equal to the summation of labour. The other thing is that capital has to pay for labour, so if a cooperative did occur, the capital has to be so low, or essentially a philanthropic donation, or labour has to take a base pay cut. This is seen in big tech compensation plans though. Labour gets paid a wage plus they get paid stocks, and they get paid even if they are in support roles and not operational roles. Support = non-revenue generation. Operational = gross profit generating.

The thing is that if all businesses were cooperative, they would have a harder time scaling and thus competing on a global scale. It's similar to USSR's car company. When a business is prevented from scaling, they stick to a sustainable growth timeline, which means they can get overlapped by businesses that have more starting capital. When you restrict a businesses ability to raise capital then companies like Google could never surpass companies like GE.

Capital markets is why capital gains is encouraged. Capital markets are not guaranteed a positive return. Stock have only gone up because of innovation and profits, not solely because of exploitation. Stocks can tank and destroy wealth as well when they are overvalued. Stocks are not the summation of labour, rather they are a security with a market value. The only summation of labour is the equity value on a businesses' balance sheet. The stock value is simply a forecast model, and one that does not need to be called "exploitation."
