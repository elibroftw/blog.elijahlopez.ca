This is just an info dump of everything I've learned regarding the TN Visa from my dad and two friends.

1. Bring your official degree to customs
2. The regular customs officers are always going to be intimidating or giving "asshole" vibes. That's normal.
3. If using the Windsor border, try the tunnel first and then the bridge
4. The "interview" is very short, not sure what people online are talking about.
5. Your employer applies for a Social Security Number after you get your TN visa stamped, and you can't start working till you get your SSN.

### Sample Letters

These are letters written by lawyers, a TN visa (NAFTA) should not even require a lawyer! I recommend employers to use a variation of these letters if they don't have lawyers retained.
