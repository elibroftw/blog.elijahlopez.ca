This is a work in progress.

## Facial-Hair Shaving

- A warm shower before shaving softens the hair folicles
- If your hair is more than 1cm long, trim it with an electric trimmer before shaving
- When shaving with a razor, do not press it against your skin because it will cause razor burns
- First pass shaving should be downwards on your face, downward/sideways for chin and upwards for your neck & underchin
- At your second or third pass, try shaving against the grain (opposite of above). Do not press against your skin or force it. It is painful for some parts, but as long as you don't press against your skin, you should be good.

## Eye Brows
