## 2024: Starbucks Gud

Good variety of new drinks. I never drank their stupid whip cream drinks again though.

## 2022: Starbux Sux

After not going to a startbucks for more than two years, I went yesterday and today due to proximity in this
30+ degrees celsius weather.

I had the choice to select from 4 of the promoted drinks. Two had coffee and two were similar to juices.

Yesterday I got the chocolate ice cofee as it was recommended by the employee and it tasted like garbage. Not even close to an ice cap. It's possible this is because I don't drink coffee, but coffee is nothing but grinded coffee beans brewed with water, so I would expect Starbuck's additional mixing to at least taste good.

Today, I got a pinappele lemonade. What genius came up with this idea? Not only does it taste like a watery pineapple, but the lemonade leaves my throat dry. How can a drink taste worse than water?! Ridiculous.

This is probably what I get for thinking Starbucks and general premium priced products are actually good.

Throwback to that time when my dad bought be a Casio graphing calculator while everyone elsed bought 4x priced Texas Instruments graphing calculators and had to be taught how to use it.

North American companies are filled with beauracracy and this will only hurt them when people who have the time start to take advantage of it.
