summary: "A compilation of purpose-built rentals in Toronto and whether they should be considered to lease from"

In the future, I'll embed Google Maps with pins for each building.

I took a lot of rentals from [Torontoism](https://torontoism.com/purpose-built-rentals-toronto/), but have ordered them myself based on my preferences.

## Livmore

- Bay & Gerrard
- [website](https://www.gwlraresidential.com/apartments/on/toronto/the-livmore-bay-gerrard)
- A two-storey sky Lounge on the 26th floor is sick!
- Pricier at $3086/mo

Based on this review, seems like a pretty good building. With the added bonus of being rent-controlled.

> Regarding management, I have had a couple of issues like my heater not working and I put in a ticket just for them to send a technician the next day to be fixed. I have never really spoken to them directly so maybe that is where other's issues have arised.
