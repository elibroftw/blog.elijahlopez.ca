summary: A ranking of countries by lowest unemployment rate
---

This list's primary purpose is to aid English speaking Canadians obtain a job. To do this, we need to filter out countries that are just unrealistic for Canadians to move to.

Reasons to filter a country out: how developed the country is, how useful speaking only English can be, and how big of a population there is. Typically, we want a population greater than 10M.

Country | Unemployment Rate | Population | Sample jobs, and gender
-- | -- | -- | --
Singapore | 2.1% | 5.8M | Any
Japan | 2.5% | -- |  Teach english, tech
Switzerland | 2.8% | -- | Tech?
Thailand | 1.2% | -- | Teach english
Qatar | 0.13% | 3.1M | Oil (Engineering), male
Saudi Arabia | 3.5% | 34.5M | Oil (Engineering), male
Netherlands | 3.9% | 18.3M | ?
Australia | 4.1% | 27.0M | ?
USA | 4.2% | 347M | ?

Advice: aside from oil countries, where English is enough, you should take language study schools for 1yr in the country of choice, and work part-time jobs with English speaking places.

## What is a good policy

Seems like unemployment is a global issue. Therefore, we need to really utilize the government to properly ensure everyone is taken care of. What does that mean?

1. Boost EI duration and cut down on non-EI welfare; EI should be more than disability
2. Limit EI to permanent residents and non-criminals; criminals who have not yet served their time should not be given EI

Currently, EI is $695 per week and lasts from 14 weeks to 45 weeks. 45 weeks is like 10 months.
