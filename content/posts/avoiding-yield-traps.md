The biggest red flag is when the dividend yield is higher than the EPS. In these scenarios, the dividend is funded by cashflows and not income, and at a certain point in the future, when that cashflow is required as capital investment, the dividend cannot be sustained.

There's a reason why cashflow is higher than net income, and that reason is usually depreciation which indicates that in the future, a capital investment (cashflow only transaction) will be made. Thus, it is imperative to judge a companies dividend based on their net income and not their cash flows.

One situation where it's not a red flag is if the company has had dividend increases for 50+ years. If the company has not been around for that long, just assume it's a yield trap. Technically, you could get away with using a % of the yield to buy puts that are equal to a drop of the yield.

A second situation where it's not a red flag is if a company had a spinoff, because the dividend is expected to be cut.
