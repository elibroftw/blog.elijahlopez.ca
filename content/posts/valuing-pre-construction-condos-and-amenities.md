I haven't come across a good article on how to buy pre-construction so I'll offer my perspective. For the sake of simplicity, I will be using a 2bd2ba 101 Spadina as my point of reference since that's the only condo building that has both affordable units (assuming household income 150k+) and is livable (high quality build, extra sound proofing, open rooftop).

## Builder

Possibly the most important factor is the builder. You need to research the builder, particularly their past projects. If a builder is new at condo building, they should be building something in a smaller city and with less floors. Does it really make sense to you to trust a builder with 20% of the total price for years for something they have no experience doing?

Devron Development is a highly reputable builder.

## Timeline

With pre-construction condos, you have to mind the timeline. In the case of 101 Spadina, it's 4 years from signing to completion, or 3 years from building, assuming without any delays. So the obvious conclusion is knowing when this completion will be the most useful for you. As someone who plans to live in the unit, it would be the most useful in 2027 and beyond, and assuming I start a family in 2031, that's when it would be useful for renting out. Since I want it to be a primary residence for tax purposes, I need it completed by 2031 by the latest, or a 3 year delay.

Delays are tolerable for this particular project since I'm young but also because the Ontario Line is projected to be completed in 2031.

Even from a renter's perspective, a delay in occupancy means keeping money longer in the stock market, and having lower monthly cash outflows.

From an investors perspective, equity builds for longer, rent revenue will probably be higher by the time it completes, and you don't have to pay the monthly outgoing price.

The one perspective that is a con for the timeline is if you already have children (living in a SFH), have plans to get married, and want to have children very soon. If you plan to have children soonish and don't have a property to live in, you might have to target units that are 2 full bedrooms 2 bathrooms and because of the timeline situation, it might be better to buy a resale.

## Location

Choose the city/neighbourhood you want to live in and compare properties within that neigbourhood since comparing across cities doesn't make sense when each city and neighborhood has different levels of demand.

- even within a city, each project will have a walkability score
- a walkability score in my opinion implies how appealing the unit will be if the renter has no car
- on the other hand, the lower the walkability score, the more dependent on cars the renter will be meaning that you as a buyer need to buy a parking spot and will be losing money on rent because renters will have car expenses
- in my opinion, spending money on rent rather than a car is a fair tradeoff, especially when you consider having significantly lower commute times

Comparing residential properties across cities is amatuerish and in a big city like Toronto, even comparing across neighbourhoods is amateurish. It's amateurish because cities have different premiums. There are real nice houses in Windsor that are newly built selling for less than condos in Toronto. The problem is that not everyone is working from home and can just live in any city in Canada or the world. If someone can live in any city in Canada, why even choose WIndsor and not Edmonton?

So when trying to find comparables, you need to consider transportation, which is easily $30,000 in value if you need to own a car.

## Amenities and Features

This is one that is extremely hard to value, so the way I do it is to find substitutes and then pricing the amenity based on if it's missing in comparables. If both buildings have the same amenity, it should have an affect on comparing prices. However, 101 Spadina has a rooftop terrace that I really like and completely blows out the lack of concrete balconies (which also makes it difficult to heat the unit). The way I priced the amenitiy is by seeing how much it would cost if for every day you'd use that rooftop terrace you'd pay to use it somewhere else.

So that would be at least $10 per day at a rooftop cafe and let's say once a week on average. So $520 per year or at least $2,600 over 5 years (without accounting for inflation).

## Inflation

When comparing the pre-construction unit to a resale unit, financially we want the similar price per square foot (excluding parking spot). Since this is a future price per square foot.

## Maintenance Fee

Maintenance fees are usually per square foot, however even a difference of $500 is possibly $100,000+ in invisible pricing. Think for a second:

$500,000 condo in a bad location with $500 more per month in maintenance fees or a $600,000 condo in a superb location? With the former, you're paying $150,000 more across 25 years which I is less than the interest on an extra $100,000 loan (APR 5%).

## Incentives

Incentives are basically what the developer offers that is unusual for pre-construction condos. So for example, if it's standard to ask for 15-20% deposits upfront, an extended deposit structure is an incentive. If it's standard for developers to pay the Bank of Canada interest rate policy minus 1% on deposits, then an incentive is the builder paying a higher interest rate on deposits.

## Why Not Resale?

This is the biggest issue for me regarding a pre-construction. If you have the money to buy a condo today, why would you spend the same money as a downpayment and wait for a few years? It doesn't make sense if you currently rent, so it only makes sense if you are not living in the country or are living at home. Are pre-constructions best for people living at home?

- living at home: good if the pre-con price is competitive, since you also get paid interest (if interest rates go down, the price will go up once it comes on the market)
- renting: good if rent-controlled, bad if paying market rent
- already own a place: bad because you will have to pay HST. It's pure speculation unless you've already run income projections
- are an only child: bad because housing isn't a concern for you, bad if you think the initial capital ($80,000+) can be used effectively for something else like undervalued stocks, good if you want to live in a different area, good if the rent income will outperform the market
