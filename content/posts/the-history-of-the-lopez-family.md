This is a recount of my family's history. Let's start with my dad's paternal grandfather (PPGF).

My PPGF, built our family house called Amjul. He worked for the municipality.

As my paternal grandfather (henceforth Opa) was growing up, his mom died when he was still young, so there was pressure for him to marry soon so that his younger brothers good get taken care of. My paternal grandmother's family was simply there continuously talking to my paternal grandfather's side so although my paternal grandfather wanted to be with someone else there was an arranged marriage. My PPGF died a year later and so my paternal grandmother (Oma) ended up being over-worked in the house and essentially raised two generation of children: the younger brothers of my paternal grandfather as well as their own four kids: two elder daughters, and my dad, and a younger daughter.

Both my Opa and Oma had the last name "Lopes" (Portuguese). It was my grandfather decided to change the spelling of our last name to Lopez.

My mom's sister and my dad's sister were friends, and so that is how my parents met each other.

I was born in 2001. I was born with a birth defect so the stress of my birth is why I don't have siblings.

I only really like talking about myself but we'll speed run some information.

On my mother's side, we have her mom (my Ayah) and her dad (my Bapa). They have a wonderful family house with mango trees which was recently renovated. I hope to see it next year.

Bapa died in 2017 - 2019, Oma died in 2021, and Opa died in 2022. Ayah is still living good although out of all four, she was the one who got a hip injury.

Most of the history is collection from my dad and mom, but I just don't feel like writing every detail, and so I won't.
