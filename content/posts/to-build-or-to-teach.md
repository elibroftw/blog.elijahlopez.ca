Dear readers,

My life has come to a point where I have to choose between building or producing content. I thoroughly enjoyed my time writing a plethora of blog posts over the years, and I have many unfinished drafts still left. As I was going through my drafts today, I came to a sudden realization of the extent of my knowledge. I want to raise the calibre of developers around the world, but I don't want to fall behind myself. I'm not _just_ a teacher.

I'm more than that. I know I'm more than that.

I'm _ambitious_.

I'm _hungry_.

I get _fired up_.

The answer is obvious to me. Building is the best option; I have the time and resources.

Regards,

Elijah
