In the long-term, investing in a basket of biotech stocks results in losses. The implication being that "winning" banks on investing in specific companies that have merit, something that all companies should actually have when they are publicly traded, but I guess not. Therefore, when investing as a basket, the goal should be to auto-sell all stock for a profit and bar reinvestment for 5 years. As in, if the company can survive 5 more years, maybe it's worth a retry.

The other thing to note is that this entire industry should be treated as a single weight. As in even if it's 20+ companies, invest as if it's all one stock. The commission fees alone might make this too expensive, and that's another reason not to invest in biotech.

As another filter, we could invest in stocks that have proven to be financially well run. One indicator is layoffs.

When selling for profit, say 40%, "reinvest" half of the profit in the same company and let it ride, but take your profit + base elsewhere.
