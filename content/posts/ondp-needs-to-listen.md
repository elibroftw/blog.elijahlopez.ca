My dad has to work in the USA because there's no jobs here.
My mom had to go to Kincardine for her job.
She doesn't want payouts. She wants jobs. Our own refinery. Our own manufacturing.

Why is she voting for Doug Ford. Has experience. She cannot have another person while tariffs are going on.

My mom also frequently gets confused with the NDP since the ONDP shares 3 out of 3 .

Permits for starting projects takes too many years.

Some sacrifice for jobs.

ONDP said not to rely once
