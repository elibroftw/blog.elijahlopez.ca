[Some Thoughts About the Social Implications of Accessible Computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1463891.1463917)

Thanks ChatGPT:

> The authors argue that accessible computing, which refers to the ability of individuals to access and use computers easily, can have far-reaching implications for social change. They discuss how accessible computing can promote increased efficiency and productivity, greater accessibility to information, and enhanced communication between people. However, they also raise concerns about the potential negative effects of computing on privacy, personal relationships, and employment. The authors conclude that accessible computing has the potential to both improve and challenge existing social structures, and that it is important to carefully consider the social implications of this technology as it continues to evolve.

1. Privacy: The authors argue that accessible computing could lead to a loss of privacy. They note that as more information becomes available online, it becomes easier for individuals and organizations to collect data on people without their knowledge or consent. This could have serious consequences for personal privacy and civil liberties.
2. Social isolation: The authors suggest that accessible computing could contribute to social isolation, as people become increasingly reliant on digital communication and interaction at the expense of face-to-face interaction. They note that this could have negative consequences for mental health and social well-being.
3. Employment: The authors note that accessible computing could lead to job displacement and unemployment, particularly in industries that rely on manual labor or routine tasks. They suggest that this could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.
4. Digital divide: The authors argue that accessible computing could widen the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not, creating a digital divide that could have serious social and economic consequences.

[Human Values and the Future of Technology: A Declaration of Empowerment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/97344.97360)

- argues for a more human-centric approach for designing and implementing technology
- principles:
  - Respect for human rights: Technology should be designed and implemented in a way that upholds human rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and access to information.
  - Transparency: The design and operation of technology should be transparent, so that users understand how it works and how it affects their lives.
  - Accessibility: Technology should be accessible to all people, regardless of their age, ability, or socioeconomic status.
    - Disagree: children should not have access to some sites, it deprives them of their innocence and takes advantage of their lack of consciousness as well as their lack of foresight and lack of hardened morals
  - Accountability: Those who design and operate technology should be accountable for its impact on society, and there should be mechanisms in place to ensure that they are held responsible.
  - User-centered design: Technology should be designed with the needs and perspectives of users in mind, to ensure that it serves their goals and priorities.
  - Sustainability: Technology should be designed and operated in a way that minimizes its impact on the environment and promotes sustainable development.

- automobile, which brought benefits like faster transportation but also had negative consequences such as increased pollution and traffic accidents.
- internet: cyberbullying, fake news, and online harassment.
- unintended consequences can be found via: ongoing research and development, as well as greater collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and the public.

[A Future Where Everything Becomes a Computer Is as Creepy as You Feared](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/technology/future-internet-of-things.html)

- The article argues that while the convenience and efficiency of the IoT are appealing, the technology also poses significant risks to privacy and security.
- growing risk of hackers gaining access to personal information and even taking control of devices.
