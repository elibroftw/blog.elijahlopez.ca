I was watching a walking in South Korea point of view video and I loved how the city looked. I then wanted to see Mumbai and I'm met with blaring horns which is what prompted me to write this article.

Every time I go to India, one of the worst parts is the noise pollution. There is a culture to honk or beep at any inconvenience, even when there is no change in the level of inconvenience. Like why are you beeping in traffic?
It could be that the honking is due to the lack of awareness by other people on the roads or...there is a cultural issue of not wanting to give people a single inch. I say this because when I went in 2019, I sat behind my cousin on the moped was my age at the time (18) and what does he do? Honk for no reason. I've been driving in Canada for 5 years now and I've honked less than 10 times in my life but my cousin? Honks the one time I'm riding with him.

Even in the video of the city streets of Mumbai, where there's big sidewalks for people to walk, there's still beeping and honking at night in the background. It just saddens me, as an Indian, that more could be done. But what could be done. I do not always like pointing out what's wrong, I like coming up with plans for what to do about it.
