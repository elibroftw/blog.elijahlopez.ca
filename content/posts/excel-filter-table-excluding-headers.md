summary:  This Excel tutorial demonstrates how to use the FILTER formula to extract data from a table while excluding headers. This formulas also filters based on a condition (e.g., non-blank status).
---

Enter a variant of the formula below where Table1 is the name of the table (Ctrl + T to create tables in Excel). Since we are using a formula in another sheet, it might be prudent to place this on row 3 to make room for custom headers on row 1 and custom data (or another filter) on row 2.

```excel
# Enter this in A5
=FILTER(Table1[Stock]:Table1[Status],NOT(ISBLANK(Table1[Status])))
# Enter this in C5 or the width of the first formula + 1
=FILTER(Table1[Speculation]&"",NOT(ISBLANK(Table1[Status])))
```

The reason there are two formulas is because empty cells show up as "0" by filter, so if we need spill-overs, we need to use the `&""` modifier on each array separately.

Here is a snippet of Table1

| Stock                               | Status | Speculation                                 | Ticker |

| WHITEHORSE FINANCE, INC. (XNAS:WHF)    |       |                                              | WHF     |
| STELLUS CAPITAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION (XNYS:SCM) | BUY    |                                              | SCM     |
| LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY (XNAS:LAMR)   |       |                                              | LAMR    |
| NEXTERA ENERGY PARTNERS UNT (XNYS:NEP)  | BUY    |                                              | NEP     |
| THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK (XTSE:TD)    |       |                                              | TD      |

After I used the formula on Table1, I got the following table. Notice that the data excludes any headers and only includes the wanted columns that had a Status.
