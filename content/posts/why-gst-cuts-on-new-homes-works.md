The concept is very simple. Right now, condo projects are not being started anymore. Why? The prices are too high. They are higher than resale in fact. Only some units are priced better, but not enough for developers to sell enough units to get the bank loan to build the building. So why aren't developers lowering the price further? Because the cost to build is too high for them to lower prices and still make a profit. The result? Capital and time is tied up for both the initial investors as well for everyone involved.

## But the Government Should Build Instead

One mentality in response to this scenario is that the government should start its own crown corporation and compete in the home building space. There are two problems I have with this.

1. If private corporations don't want to make less than 10% pre-tax profit margin, will houses priced 10% lower be considered a win?
2. The government can't expropriate the land where a condo is unprofitable to build. 101 Spadina is owned by a developer and because it is private property, the government cannot force them to build. If taxes were to go up on the land, they might be forced to sell it, but that is a municipal issue, not a federal one.
3. Land acquisition is a wealth transfer from tax payers to land hoarders. Unless the government is using it's own land to build houses, buying land to build houses is nothing but crowding out and would result in land prices going up which will have knock on effects with private developers going out of business or pivoting away. It's hard to imagine that the government can build houses better than a company that specializes at building houses.

When new homes are cheaper for all primary home buyers, and not just first-time home buyers, more existing home owners will buy new houses and move into them, thus vacating their older homes. These older homes will be cheaper to buy than new homes (due to more depreciation, and assuming the new house is of similar quality or higher). These vacated and older homes will increase the supply of homes that are within the price range of most first time home buyers. Thus, a GST cut for all primary home buyers is better than a GST cut exclusively for first time home buyers. I hope this helps in explaining my viewpoint!
