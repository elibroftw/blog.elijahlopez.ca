1) it should be percentage of tax revenue, not percentage of GDP. What if a countries GDP was composed of non taxable activities like selling primary houses? Or how about spending per soldier instead? Any % GDP goal metric ends up having influence over tax policies. There won't be any tax relief if all international agreements end up being % GDP contributions. How about an interest expense limit? We already spend 6% of Rev on interest every year. That's nuts since the government doesn't even have a tax benefit of debt. It's a literal payout to banks. 24B.
If you want to spend $40B, increase taxes or stop expanding the government more than the population increases.

2) we need to think of sustainable spending, not black hole spending. Equipment lasts decades, so instead of having spending targets, how about we have military targets? How big should our army be? How much training should be done? How many military weapons should we have (jets and helicopters included). Where should we put facilities on the border? How much international troops should we have?

3) opportunity cost and alternatives. Is spending more on military really a good idea when Canadians are complaining about Healthcare access and are visiting food banks at record numbers? How about investing internally so that even the average Canadian can benefit from billions of dollars instead of spending money on a group known for sexual misconduct? How about we spend money on tax compliance or anti corruption or internal affairs/auditing?
