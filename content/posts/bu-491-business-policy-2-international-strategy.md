## Expanding Abroad

### Multi-national Entreprise (MNE)

For this course,

- substantial direct investment
  - not just a trading relationship
- active coordinated management
  - active input into the company, not just shareholder
- strategic and organizational integration
  - operations in different countries

### Traditional Motivations

1. Market seeking: fill capacity (grow sales revenue)
2. Resource seeking
    - secure key suppliers
    - exploit factor cost differences

### Emerging Motivations

1. Industry internationalization forces: scale economies, ballooning R&D investments, shortening product life cycles
    - scale: volume
    - scope: multiple products
2. Global scanning and learning: access emerging trends, new technologies, and best skills worldwide
3. Competitive positioning: e.g. use global operations to pre-empty others, cross-subsidize markets

### Barriers to Internationalization

- different cultures have different beliefs

CAGE framework

Culture distance, Administrative / Political distance, Geographic distance, economic distance.

Packaging regulation may seem small, but still comes up.

Taking Home Depot as an example, Chinese have a Do it For me, bargaining, city centre has richer people not the suburbs, homes were smaller and required immense effort not some DIY shelf.

### Means of Internationalization

1. Export
2. Licensing
    - giving a company the right to use a trademark
3. Franchising
    - mcdonald's
4. Joint Ventures
5. Subsidiaries
6. Acquisition

### Internationalization Process Theory

Foreign direct investment (FDI):

- incremental process of learning and increasing commitment to foreign market
- perceived uncertainty and knowledge
- gradually increasing internationalization after a long period of doing business exclusively in the home market

### Global Integration vs National Responsiveness

- Transnational is both
  - everywhere
- Global is integration
  - world is one unit
- Multinational is responsiveness
  - portfolio of local opportunities, local adaptions
- International is an in between
  - domestic then international, domestic first view

## Understanding the international context

### PEST(EL)

What could happen going forward. Conclusions: want to take the probability into account to determine whether to make a decision. Identity current and future trends, summarize on supply, demand, and competition to link to Porter's 5 forces.

### Deglobalization

[Are Businesses Ready for Deglobalization?](https://hbr.org/2019/12/are-businesses-ready-for-deglobalization)

- Splinternet
  > Such a technological fragmentation \[(censorships of web platforms by different countries)] would disrupt global supply chains \[(in which manner?)] — which enable global corporations to gain a competitive edge by selecting the most cost-effective solution at each stage of the production process. And the move away from such centralized procurement \[(what is the procurement and what makes it centralized?)] raises the costs of and reduces the efficiency gains from shared global services \[(like what?)].

Unionization failed 40% to 60%.
