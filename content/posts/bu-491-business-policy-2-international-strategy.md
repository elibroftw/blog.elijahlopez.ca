1. Market seeking: fill capacity (grow sales revenue)
2. Resource seeking
    - secure key suppliers
    - exploit factor cost differences

### Emerging Motivations

1. Industry internationalization forces: scale economies, ballooning R&D investments, shortening product life cycles
    - scale: volume
    - scope: multiple products

- perceived uncertainty and knowledge
- gradually increasing internationalization after a long period of doing business exclusively in the home market

### Global Integration vs National Responsiveness

- Transnational is both
  - everywhere
- Global is integration
  - world is one unit
- Multinational is responsiveness
  - portfolio of local opportunities, local adaptions
- International is an in between
  - domestic then international, domestic first view
