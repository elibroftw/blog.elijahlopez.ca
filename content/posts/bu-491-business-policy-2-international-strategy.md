## Expanding Abroad

### Multi-national Entreprise (MNE)

For this course,

- substantial direct investment
  - not just a trading relationship
- active coordinated management
  - active input into the company, not just shareholder
- strategic and organizational integration
  - operations in different countries

### Traditional Motivations

1. Market seeking: fill capacity (grow sales revenue)
2. Resource seeking
    - secure key suppliers
    - exploit factor cost differences

### Emerging Motivations

1. Industry internationalization forces: scale economies, ballooning R&D investments, shortening product life cycles
    - scale: volume
    - scope: multiple products
2. Global scanning and learning: access emerging trends, new technologies, and best skills worldwide
3. Competitive positioning: e.g. use global operations to pre-empty others, cross-subsidize markets

### Barriers to Internationalization

- different cultures have different beliefs

CAGE framework

Culture distance, Administrative / Political distance, Geographic distance, economic distance.

Packaging regulation may seem small, but still comes up.

Taking Home Depot as an example, Chinese have a Do it For me, bargaining, city centre has richer people not the suburbs, homes were smaller and required immense effort not some DIY shelf.

### Means of Internationalization

1. Export
2. Licensing
    - giving a company the right to use a trademark
3. Franchising
    - mcdonald's
4. Joint Ventures
5. Subsidiaries
6. Acquisition

### Internationalization Process Theory

Foreign direct investment (FDI):

- incremental process of learning and increasing commitment to foreign market
- perceived uncertainty and knowledge
- gradually increasing internationalization after a long period of doing business exclusively in the home market

### Global Integration vs National Responsiveness

- Transnational is both global and multinational
  - everywhere
- Global is integration
  - world is one unit
- Multinational is responsiveness
  - portfolio of local opportunities, local adaptions
- International is an in between
  - domestic then international, domestic first view

### Multinational Company vs. Host Government

### Increased need for rapid and coordinated

- Shortening product life-cycles
- Increased cost of R&D
- Emergence of global technology standards
- Competitors’ ability to develop and diffuse innovation globally

### Deglobalization

[Are Businesses Ready for Deglobalization?](https://hbr.org/2019/12/are-businesses-ready-for-deglobalization)

- Splinternet
  > Such a technological fragmentation \[(censorships of web platforms by different countries)] would disrupt global supply chains \[(in which manner?)] — which enable global corporations to gain a competitive edge by selecting the most cost-effective solution at each stage of the production process. And the move away from such centralized procurement \[(what is the procurement and what makes it centralized?)] raises the costs of and reduces the efficiency gains from shared global services \[(like what?)].

## American Factory

- No context that GM literally failed
- Chevrolet S-10 was the first car made in 1982
- Union Auto Workers Union
- You can't smell Fuyao without F-U

- Is Fuyao an example of “How to take on the World”?
  - Fuyao is a company for automobile glass, 70% of the market.
  - Melding US and Chinese culture
  - No union
  - Used to be a GM motors plant, leaving 2,000 families unemployed and now 1,000 employees employed
- What were the major issues that impacted the company performance?

The anti-union consulting should be banned. It's classic union busting. Let unions fail naturally. Employers should not be able to pay consultants to avoid unions.

Unionization failed 40% to 60%.

### Leading Change

Why do transformation efforts fails?

## United Cereal

- Lora Brill: United Cereal’s European vice president
- March 2010
- Healthy Berry Crunch, a new breakfast cereal that the French subsidiary wanted to launch
- Started by Jed Thomson in 1910 at his grocery store in Kalamazoo, Michigan
- main competitor is Kellogs
- Local markets resulted in 25% higher SG&A expenses than in the US
- National subsidiaries each lead by a  Country Manager (CM) because of major differences
  - lead to contradictions in marketing
- most CMs now favored product extensions over new product introductions, and many increasingly relied on cost reductions in their existing portfolios to maintain
profits
- Arne Olsen, a Norwegian appointed as UC’s European VP in 2002 - 2006
- PodCafé debacle
  - First launched in Germany, but three years later copycat products showed up in other countries
- Jorge Sanchez Division VP - Southern Europe
- Jean-Luc Michel, Country Manager France

1. If you were Lora Brill, would you authorize the launch of Healthy Berry
Crunch in France?

    Yes, because competitors are also doing it and the repurchase percentage consideration is more than 60%

2. Is United Cereal a centralized or decentralized organization?

    - Centralized in terms of decision making and organization structure.
    - Decentralized because of product adaptions in every nation

3. Should Healthy Berry Crunch become a Eurobrand? Why or why not?

    No because the organization structure is not simple to covey and results in each VP taking on more responsibilities. Then there's the issue that each country would have to be on board and be capable of also launching products. Spain and Italy are not going to be able to keep up. The test cases were't done in every country either. If the overall goal is to prove that a Euro brand strategy is viable, then the first case product should be crystal clear.

4. What would you recommend if you were Lora?

    Launch Healthy Berry Crunch and create a reorganization plan so that the next product can become the Eurobrand.

5. How would you implement tour recommendation

    The two issues is the organization structure with regards to Eurobrands and the budgets for each subsidiary. With regards to organization, there needs to be a straight forward approach as James Miller said. A European product structure where there is clear authority for decision making. This would also result in lower SG&A expenses as decision making is now a stream lined process.

## Developing a Transnational Organization

- Foreign product diversity vs Foreign Sales as a Percentage of Total Sales

Global matrix structure has fallen out of favour.

- Complex and bureaucratic
- Dual reporting caused confusion

### Administrative Heritage

archetypes:

a. European empire (multinational model)
b. American empire (international model)
c. Japanese empire (global model)

### AI Article

### Beiersdorf AG

- the last quarter of 2011 had ended with a loss.
- local adaptation strategy
- restructuring was focused on get closer to becoming
the world’s best skin care company.
- old ceo was Quaas
- Markus Pinger left for obvious reasons since he did not become CEO
- Heidenreich: strong-willed and dynamic but also risk-seeking and aggressive
- Hamburg-based Global Research Center
  - Can account for climates in Asia and Latin America, not just Germany / Europe

1. What were the building blocks of the company’s success?

- innovation driven
- scientific and medical

2. What internal and external factors led the company to restructuring?

- recession leading to lower growth in consumers division and a decrease in overall revenue
- inflation was 2.7% and consumer spending was up only 0.5%

3. Did the restructuring effort address these issues? What do you think was
done well? What still needs to be done?

- not really
- the restructuring efforts looked more like a cost/efficiency change leading
to all executive board members leaving

4. On April 27th 2012, Heidenreich was appointed the new CEO. Is he the right person to lead the change? What challenges did he face from his
predecessor? How should he proceed?

- Maybe.
- worked at Hero
- In his previous position at Hero, where he had been the CEO for seven years, Heidenreich convinced many investors of his ability to generate continuous profits and grow share prices
- Hero had undergone major restructuring efforts and also had a majority shareholder

## Worldwide Innovation and Learning

Innovation comes in multiple forms:

- New technology-based products
- Organizational effectiveness breakthroughs
- Pioneering marketing strategies
- Leading-edge manufacturing processes
- Logistics innovations

- R&D expenditure globally more than doubled between 1992-2010
- Worldwide patent application
- Intangible asset valuations rose higher

Competitive battles:

- Sensing
- Responding
- Implementing

Traditional innovation

- Center-for-global
  - HQ senses opportunities
  - Dominate in international and global companies
  - Problem: market insensitivity, imperialism, fading of competitive advantage
- Local-for-local
  - Distributed assets and resources allow local response
  - multinational strategic model
  - Duplication possible, reinventing the wheel
- Locally leveraged
  - Special resources and capabilities of each national subsidiary are available to other units as well
- Globally linked
  - Resources and capabilities of many unites (center and subsidiaries) pooled to jointly create and manage an activity

### Making Transnational processes Feasible

Three simplifying assumptions:

1. Subsidiaries should be symmetrical
2. HQ-subsidiary relationship is based on
clear patterns of dependence or
independence
3. Corporate management exercises
decision-making and control uniformly

- From Symmetry to Differentiation
  - Demands for integration and responsiveness need to be addressed separately for each business, function, and geographic region
- From Dependence / Independence to Interdependence
  - Implementation of an integrated network and inter-unit integration mechanisms
- From Simple Control to Flexible Coordination
  - Complex coordination of the flow of goods, resources, and knowledge: formalization, centralization, and socialization process

Problems

- Center-for-global innovation
  - Risk of market insensitivity, imperialism
- Local-for-local innovation
  - Risk of duplication, reinventing the wheel
- Locally leveraged innovation
  - Threatened by not-invented-here (NIH)
- Globally linked innovation
  - High coordination costs

Reverse innovation is creating products in an emerging economy to meet the local needs and then bringing this product to a developed economy through adaption cannibalization of existing products. One example of reverse innovation is a $1,000 handheld electrocardio-gram device developed for rural India which also started being sold in the United States for different uses. Reverse innovation is the opposite of the standard glocalization approach taken by most manufacturing firms based in rich countries.

[THE CHANGING FACE OF INNOVATION IN CHINA](https://ocul-wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_WLU/s6kavd/cdi_proquest_journals_2074380396)

The first step is to ensure local representation which I agree with however it also says "local R&D management style better suited to Chinese sensitivities" which in my opinion isn't a 100% guarantee or objectively better. Management style is subjective and so if anything, the style should be whichever one results in higher productivity. Sure it could be that being better suited to Chinese sensitivities is correct, or maybe the original management style was lacking already. There isn't only one management style in north america so obviously there isn't only one in China. The next step is to speed up the patenting when trade secrets is not strategic. I don't agree with this from a philosophical point of view because the government point of patents is to dissuade trade secrets but leveraging the patent policy because trade secrets is non-strategic goes against what the patent system was about. In these cases, the innovation should be multi-group just like the media codec VP9 vs. the proprietary H265. Innovation isn't just an individual corporation point of view, but a macro-economical point of view itself. If we told every individual to only look out for themselves, then there would be vast social problems and high crime rates because no one wants to work towards a greater cause. The last step is to integrate R&D and IP management competencies. Although I disagree with mass patenting, I can agree that when patents are acquired as originally intended, it's utility should be maximized rather than ignored; This can be done by the R&D department communicating with the IP management either through 1:1 or through a middle manager in charge of this task.

What is reverse innovation?

- Develop products for markets in
emerging economies
- Sell in developed markets

Example: the electrocardiogram device
for rural India and the ultrasound
machine for rural China

Why is it important?
• Many emerging markets are no longer small
• They have high growth rates
• Glocalization ignored faster growing middle or
lower-end customer segment in emerging
markets
• Potential local new entrants can enter
developed markets with low cost alternatives
Reversed innovation isn’t optional, its oxygen!


- decentralization
- traditional centralized structures
provide cost benefits
-

Project-level actions
Establish Local Growth Teams (LGTs)
1.Shift the power to where the growth is
Authority to decide what to develop and
how to produce, sell, and service
2.Build new offerings from the ground up
3.Build LGT from ground up
4.Customize objectives, targets, measure
5.report to someone high in the organization

China

Foreign companies must retool their R&D
strategies to keep pace with newly
innovative Chinese enterprises.

Foreignness is becoming a liability
• Intellectual property (IP) regime has
strengthened
• Risks with keeping and sharing advanced
technology
• Innovation transaction costs can jeopardize
the lead
• Time to market of innovative products and
services

Strike a balance between localization and
the growing liability of foreignness;
• Engage in cutting edge research when
returns exceed global;
• Focus talent, culture and operations toward
faster time to market.

### Answers

Three important capabilities that are necessary for effective central innovation are: taking  in information from subsidiaries to the centralized head quarter through the use of creating linkages (taskforce focusing on a region, activities, meetings, etc.) that increase interaction between local managers and the central head quarters; ensuring that all functional tasks are linked to market needs through the use of direct consumer contact and feedback; and integrating value-chain functions by managing the transfer of responsibilities across development, production, and marketing. The goal of managing responsibility transfer is to reduce the loss of proximity from a centralized approach to development<->marketing rather than a decentralized approach where the functions are close to each other. Thus, the last capability is to ensure that research, production, and marketing remains as integrated in a centralized perspective as was by default in the local-for-local innovation.

One capability to make local innovations efficient is to empower the local management. Local management referring to managers of the subsidiaries. Empowering local management means to hand over, or delegate, organization resources and decision making authority to the subsidiary managers. It could be as simple as investing assets into the subsidiary because then the innovation would be local led even if the starting direction was done by the central HQ.
Another capability is to provide a link (collaboration) between the different federations so that knowledge and techniques can be shared without reinventing the wheel. Lastly, there needs to be cross-functional integration at all local subsidiaries to ensure that the ideas being generated are high quality.

One capability necessary for making innovations feasible is to make each subsidiary differentiate itself where it needs to to avoid resource misallocation and competing ineffectively.  Therefore, integration and responsiveness needs to be tweaked separately for each subsidiary. A second capability is interdependence which requires the existence of roles in the organization that creates a network such that information is always relayed will reach someone in central or local regardless of where the information is coming from. There also needs to be integration between units so that units are not in conflict with each other. The last capability is to allow for flexibility in coordination and control. In other words, being stringent results in one way to do something even if it may not be optimal whereas flexibility means having sophisticated processes to deal with different issues in appropriate more caring manners.

### P&G JAPAN: THE SK-II GLOBALIZATION PROJECT

> In November 1999, Paolo de Cesare was preparing for a meeting with the Global Leadership Team (GLT) of P&G’s Beauty Care Global Business Unit (GBU) to present his analysis of whether SK-II, a prestige skin care line from Japan, should become a global P&G brand.

> president of Max Factor Japan, the hub of P&G’s fast-growing cosmetics business in Asia

proposal to expand SK-II into China and Europe.

> Chairing the GLT meeting was Alan (“A. G.”) Lafley, head of P&G’s Beauty Care GBU, to which de Cesare reported

> In 1985, as the first step in developing a program hecalled “Ichidai Hiyaku” (“The Great Flying Leap”), new country GM Durk Jager analyzed the causes of P&G’s spectacular failure in Japan. the company had not recognized the distinctive needs and habits of the very demanding Japanese consumer. (For instance, P&G Japan had built its laundry-detergent business around All Temperature Cheer, a product that ignored the Japanese practice of doing the laundry in tap water, not a range of water temperatures.)

Increased R&D size

1991 bubble burst causing 20% total decline.

Implementing O2005, as it came to
be called, he promised would bring 13% to 15%
annual earnings growth and would result in $900
million in annual savings starting in 2004. Implementation would be painful, he warned; in the first
five years, it called for the closing of 10 plants and
the loss of 15,000 jobs–13% of the worldwide
workforce. The cost of the restructuring was estimated at $1.9 billion, with $1 billion of that total
forecast for 1999 and 2000.

“And if you are worried about oversight,” he said, “I am the portfolio manager.

Lots of bureaucratic cutting.

Reading: Joint Ventures and Partnerships in a Downturn (Harvard Business Review
September 2020)

Case: Nora-Sakari: A Proposed JV In Malaysia

- On Monday, March 11, 2013, Zainal Hashim, vice-chairman of Nora Holdings Sdn  Bhd (Nora). Meeting in Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia
  - Nora was a leading supplier of telecommunications (telecom) equipment in Malaysia
- Negotiating with Sakari Oy2 (Sakari) of Finland
  - leader in the manufacture and deployment of mobile broadband network infrastructure
- Joint venture negotiation
  - manufacture and commission 4G (fourth generation) mobile network equipment in Malaysia
- In August 2012, TMB called for tenders to bid on a two-year project worth RM1 billion for building an LTE radio access network in various parts of the country.
- Local tellecom's often needed partnerships with MNCs because they lacked the technological capabilities themselves
- Sakari’s SK4LTE platform was criticized for failing to make any impact in the United States, one of the world’s largest and most important mobile markets.
- WOS: wholly owned subsidiary legalized in Malyasis, however JV's still seen as more efficient

- Negotiation
  - Nora’s general manager for corporate planning division, an accountant, two engineers, and Marina Mohamed, a lawyer
  - Kuusisto, Sakari’s vice-president. His team comprised Junttila, Hussein Ghazi, Aziz Majid, three engineers, and Julia Ruola, a lawyer. Ghazi was Sakari’s senior manager who was of Egyptian origin and also a Muslim who had worked for Sakari for more than 20 years, while Aziz, a Malay, had been Sakari’s manager for more than 12 years.
- Nora’s capability in penetrating the Southeast Asian market. Other issues included Sakari’s concerns over the efficiency of Malaysian workers in manufacturing, maintaining product quality and ensuring prompt deliveries.

1. Why have negotiations failed to result in an agreement?
    - Zainal admitted making the mistake of applying the approach he often used when negotiating with companies based in North America or the United Kingdom
    - Negotiators from the U.S. tend to be very open and often state their positions early and definitively
    - Sakari negotiators are serious, reserved and ‘cold.’
      - it was difficult to determine whether they are really interested in the deal or not.
    - Equity Ownership
      - Sakari proposed an equity split of 49 per cent for Sakari and 51 per cent for Nora. Nora, on the other hand, proposed a 30 per cent Sakari and 70 per cent Nora split
      - foreign equity ownership rules of 30% liberalized by the Malaysian government effective July 1998
      - Nora had concerns about its ability to exert control over the JV because it was intended as a key part of its longterm strategy to develop its own mobile broadband equipment and related high-tech products
      - Nora wants a technology transfer, whereas Sakari wants that protected
    - Royalty payments
      - 5% of gross sales Sakari, 2% of net sales Nora
    - Salaries
      - Sakari's offer was exorbitant
      - Take-it-or-lave it stance adopted by Nora
      - Sakari would have to subsidize the difference (are they really being paid $300,000?)
    - Arbitration

2. What is motivation of each company?
    - Sakari
      - Growth, concerned about tech leakage
    - Nora
      - Sustainable technological knowledge gain
3. As Zainal, what are your options to fulfill the TMB contract?
    - Samsug, Sakari, NEC
4. What criteria could be used to facilitate agreement between the
companies?
    - TEST
For class, be prepared to act as part of the negotiation team for either company.
You will be challenged to come up with an agreement that meets the objectives
of both companies
