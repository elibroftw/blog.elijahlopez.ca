## Preface

As I'm writing this, I would say I'm agnostic. I believe in God, however I left Catholicism because I did not feel like I or my mind was wanted or belonged in Church/prayer, just as how I don't feel wanted in other areas of life, including university-life and by people around me.

I'm writing this because of a rabbit hole. A rabbit hole that started because of a theory I developed some time ago (before this blog existed) known as [reactionary politics](/posts/politics-reactionary-theory). It is my belief that evil persists because of this theory of mine. It's an optional read and I don't believe it is very polished.

## Introduction

Jesus said to his disciples, "teach them \[people] to obey everything I have commanded you" - Matthew 28:16-20

In these notes of mine, I will share and analyze what Jesus commanded his disciples in the _book of Matthew_. As a person who is objective, we should each make notes ourselves and only use the internet to clarify what a sentence means rather than drawing broad conclusions such as what it means to be Christian.

 As it stands, to be Catholic means to support all leaders of the church (popes) that came after Saint Peter, including the current pope, which I do not support. That is what Catholic means. It is used currently as a synonym for Christianity, but it is totally incorrect once you understand that Catholicism isn't just a religion, it's a system.

 I will be reading from the English Standard Version as it "combines word-for-word precision and accuracy with literary excellence, beauty, and readability" rather than substituting words. I'm choosing this over "New American Standard Bible NAS" because I want both accuracy and readability, not just accuracy. The New International Version does thought for thought translations that could've been mis-interpreted in the first place. Put shortly, NAS requires a lot of critical thinking, NIV skips critical thinking, ESV will be just right.
