A Chic-fil-a has opened in Burlington, Ontario in the plaza of Appleby and Dundas. Right across from it is Dave's Hot Chicken, and in the same plaza is a KFC. In the adjacent plaza there is a joint called Might Bird. Only at Upper Middle do we find a Popeyes. One of the things keeping me away from eating fast food these days is a lack of appetite a goal of hitting a caloric deficit.

1. Dave's Hot Chicken (10/10)
2. Mighty Bird (more expensive than Chic-Fil-A, not as good as Dave's Hot Chicken)
3. Chic-Fil-A (5/10 do not recommend the chicken nuggets, sandwich still a TODO)
4. Church's Texas Chicken (recommend only the sandwich for value, do not get the onion rings, fries, or watered down fountain drinks)
5. KFC (do not recommend unless you want to get obese)
