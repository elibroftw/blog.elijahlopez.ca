title: "Centrist Questionnaire"
date: 2025-01-21T15:10:27-05:00
draft: true
summary: "This post proposes a 'Centrist Questionnaire' to identify genuinely centrist political stances. It includes questions on the Israel-Palestine conflict (requiring support for Palestinian self-determination), Venezuela (critiquing blind support for its elections), self-defense cases (Kyle Rittenhouse, Jordan Neely, George Floyd), and Canadian inter-provincial trade (opposing 'smuggling' laws), aiming to distinguish centrists from those leaning left or right."

It's time to make a Centrist Questionnaire.

### Stance on Israel-Palestine

I put this one first to weed out Liberals who claim to be centrists. With regards to Palestine, a centrist will accept the minimum stance being: the right to self-determination shall be granted

### Stance on Venezuela

I put this one second to weed out Far-leftists who claim to be rational. The far-left likes to ride on a high horse about how moral and rational they are by calling the other side rational but will believe in Venezuelan elections even when the numbers are very fishy. They only believe in the election results because they value being against a political ideology (e.g. Americanism) over actual democracy. If Authoritarian is what is needed to"show it to" America, the far-left will support it over democracy. Even then, what is Venezuela showing to America? Why not support China and drop Venezuela? Why would anyone on the left want to live in Venezuela over China?

### Stance on Self-Defence

Kyle Rittenhouse: self defence

Killing of Jordan Neely: not self-defence, should be guilty of at least manslaughter. When i'ts a 3v1, I don't believe killing a person is necessary.

George Floyd: A centrist police officer would disregard any police department kneeling technique, and would not apply it when the victim stops resisting. A centrist would not support charges on the other police officers involved.

### Inter-Provincial Trade

See R v. Comeau. Basically a centrist would not support a sting operation nor woulld support laws that call transportation of goods and services across a provincial border "smuggling."
