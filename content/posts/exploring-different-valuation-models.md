In my advanced corporate finance class, we were introduced to the residual earnings.

Basically I want to propose a few different capital and payout structures and judge the same company under these differences.

1. All equity, no debt, firm pays no dividends
    - Hypothesis: behaves like GOOGL
2. All equity, no debt, firm pays dividend with payout ratio above 50%
    - Hypothesis: because the payout ratio is so high, there is limited growth. Point one is that the consistent dividend attracts investors with lower costs of equity. Just because the market has its own high cost of equity, this dividend is seem as safe. Point number two is that because the firm has already been bid up due to low cost of equity investors, and the payout ratio is already 50%+, the expected return is lower than if the dividend did not exist!
    - There is a bird in hand preference as well, which contributes to the attraction of low cost of equity investors.
    - My takeaway is that for high payout ratio stocks, the best way to capture value is to either have a low cost of equity (< 4%), or invest during a bust cycle.
    - Study idea: dividend payout ratio versus return on equity
3. Half debt half equity, no dividend
4. Half debt half equity, dividend payout ratio above 50%
5. High debt firm, dividend payout ratio less than 50%
6. High debt firm, dividend payout ratio above 50%

Another theory I want to explore is the usage of the residual earnings. We've continued to assume that it will be invested for growth, but since new equipment purchase are only depreciated but never taken out of the statement, maybe we need to just look at realistic cash flows.

### A New Equity Account

When the company reinvest earnings into capital expenditure, in my opinion, the company needs to move equity from _Retained Earnings_ to a new account called _Reinvested Earnings_. This way, investors can look at a balance sheet, see which equity value will realistically be paid out without liquidating the firm, and see which equity is used to maintain operations.

Until this is codified, I suggest bookkeeping Retained Earnings into two subgroups, _Operational Earnings_, and _Liquid Investment_

The other thing is that when thinking about the balance sheet, we realize that it can't be used to value the firm, because it does not account for the present value of its future cash flows!

### Other Techniques to Explore

- Fair value
- Present value of cashflows
- Market values

Good examples: pure play profit (REITs). Pure play holding company (SCM, banks?), mixed use (BRK)
