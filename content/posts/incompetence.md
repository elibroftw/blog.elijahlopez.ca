This is a list of incompetence experienced in my life. It doesn't matter if you are in debt, have $0 in your name, are rich,
are a billionaire, or are a corporation worth billions of dollars.

## BMO

This is the bank that offers small businesses a free business bank account as long as you do all your transactions online.
Pretty simple? WRONG.

I was trying to file taxes, and I needed to consolidate my banks statements so that I could journal my expenses for the year.
(Lazy me didn't want to do it monthly). So I go to the bank UI to download transactions and pick April 21 2021 - April 20 2022.
I click CSV download and guess what the CSV has? It only has two transactions from May 2022. I wrote a very angry
and unprofessional message to BMO because what kind of billion dollar corporation can't even do a simple CSV download properly?

I wish I was a billionaire. I'd start a bank to give these billion dollar banks REAL competition. RBC charges a monthly fee
for a business account, so I can understand why the best = paid. For now, I'm going to move to CIBC which will hopefully not
give me a massive migraine. If CIBC doesn't go well I'll go with RBC since I bank there personally and have dislike their customer
support personnel.

### Navigation bar isn't real

I have the bank UI zoomed in and noticed blurryness. Look at how fake these guys are.

### CIBC

June 21st 2022

I closed my BMO account and got a bank draft of my account balance minus $10. I go to CIBC and the lady there tells me the funds would've been put on hold and that
since my business account doesn't even have ID, I need to speak to my business advisor. But I don't have a business advisor since
I onended up the account online. I end up going on a wild goose chase for another hour and then decided to just go
with RBC since they have the best UI and I already personal bank with them. They charge a monthly fee of $6, but at least
I know I'm getting COMPETENT service. I opened and verified my account with just a phone call and some emails.
