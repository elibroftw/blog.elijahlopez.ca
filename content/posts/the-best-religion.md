I support the right to practice and wear whatever you want but I denounce the
brainwashing of children. Religious indoctrination is immoral and unethical, especially when children are forced into belief. [How to ~~Raise~~ Indoctrinate a Muslim Child](https://www.wikihow.com/Raise-a-Muslim-Child).
The other thing, is the unjust circumcision of boys. It is genital mutilation, the baby feels pain,
and it is irreversible. These boys will never know the feeling of the penis with all its nerves.
It is simply unfathomable to not have the foreskin. Most men choose not to get a circumcision when they
are old enough to get the surgery. People rationalize circumcision by claiming it ensures hygiene,
but hygiene comes from showering often and genital mutilation is harmful unless the outcome is more harm.
If you aren't showering often, you're unhygienic no matter if you lack your foreskin. It is the parents
responsibility to keep their young child clean, and being ignorant of the human anatomy is not an excuse
in the 21st century.

And if you don't agree with this circumcision ethics, we can still tackle the problem with raising your child
to be Muslim. I picked Muslim, because Christian children aren't raised to pray 5 times a day as well as to devote
large amounts of time to their religion. Christianity is not squeaky clean, but it's not as dirty as Islam.

For an example where Christianity goes wrong, the ban on contraceptives by the Pope; Yes this is Catholicism,
however Catholics make up a large chunk of Christians.

There is a difference between indoctrination and telling your kid that Santa is real.
The difference is that when the kid asserts their parents are the ones planting the presents, the parents
aren't going to be super defensive about it. Here is a conversation with a kid if the kid could stand up for themselves.

```txt
Parents:  Pray 5 times a day to Allah
Kid:      Why?
Parent 1: Because I said so!
Parent 2: Because it says so in the Qur'an
Kid:      So what?
Parent 2: The Qur'an is the word of Allah
Kid:      How do you know that?
Parent 2: Because he told Muhammed to write it.
Kid:      How do you know Allah told Muhammed?
Parent 2: Because an angel appeared before him and he visited heaven.
Kid:      How do you know an angel appeared before him and he visited heaven?
Parent 1: Because it says so in the Qur'an!
Parent 2: Because he said so and Muhammed would never lie, he is the prophet
Kid:      How do you know he would never lie?
Parents:  Because he was the last prophet of Allah!
Kid:      But how do you know that he is the last prophet of Allah?
Parent 2: I told you, the Qur'an says so itself.
Kid:      When the Qur'an wasn't written yet, was Muhammed a prophet?
Parent 2: Yes
Kid:      And how was that possible?
Parent 2: Because Allah spoke to him
Kid:      Why did the people believe him?
Parents:  Because he was the prophet!
Kid:      Then how come I'm not convinced!?
```

This Indoctrination makes people take pride in their delusions.

Let's take a look at [Why do Muslim Women Wear Hijab](https://medium.com/interfaith-now/why-do-muslim-women-wear-hijab-8d0cd811e2b1).

> I had stopped wearing a headscarf because I didn’t know why I was wearing it.
> I felt like a fraud. When people asked me, I had canned lines from Muslim websites and memes I could regurgitate.
> But none of them rang true in my heart. It all felt hollow and forced. It was affecting my faith.

This is my first argument too. You shouldn't do things repeatedly without reason.

> Allah told women to wear it in the Qur’an. He did not tell husbands to have their wives put it on.

And as I predicted, we get the pseudo-reason. Rather than delve deeper into the reasons immediately,
we now have to read paragraphs of filler before getting to an actual reason.

> It is entirely about being a woman.

Another pseudo-reason! This is equivalent to saying circumcision is entirely about being a man.
There's no logic to it, it's just another indirect reason. Additionally, she admits she didn't
know which parts of being a woman.

> Dressing modestly is to show that we want to be valued separately from our sexuality.

Her first proposition is mentioned in a section about what people assume about the hijab!
However, this proposition and the conclusion requires the definition of modest to include that a woman's hair is to be covered.
And then, if modest does include women covering their hair, what is the underlying reason that makes a woman without a hijab or/and
why would a woman with a hijab be more modest than if she did not have one on?

> To show that we are Muslim.<br>
> That is the most compelling reason.<br>
> When I put on the scarf, I am telling the world that I believe in Allah and His prophet, Muhammad ([pbuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_honorifics)).

The reason is pride, but the pride is because of an appeal to authority as I predicted earlier.
This woman has chosen to be more pride about her faith that she was raised to be in than her own hair.
In my opinion, her self-identity has been consumed by her religion.

So the argument to convince Muslims that they're wasting their effort in wearing the Hijab becomes a lot harder/simpler;
We have to prove the religion itself is incorrect and wrong to believe in.

[Divine Revelations](https://www.metmuseum.org/learn/educators/curriculum-resources/art-of-the-islamic-world/unit-one/the-prophet-muhammad-and-the-origins-of-islam)

> When he was roughly forty, Muhammad began having visions and hearing voices.<br>
> Searching for clarity, he would sometimes meditate at Mount Hira, near Mecca.<br>
> On one of these occasions, the Archangel Gabriel (Jibra'il in Arabic) appeared to him and instructed him to recite "in the name of \[your] lord."

This is the reason you believe God talked to Muhammed?? His word? Source: trust me bro.

The Earth used to be flat, the Earth used to be the centre of the universe, and unless our world changes course,
hopefully one day humans can say "the world used to have religous indoctrination."
