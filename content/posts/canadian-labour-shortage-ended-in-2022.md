My definition of a labour shortage is that every month, more people are employed than the number of people entering the labour force. When there is no noticeable decrease in the people unemployed, we're at full employment and there is no labour shortage.

Even [StatCan figured it out](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2023009-eng.htm), there was no need for immigration as of July 2023, yet it took the government over a year to realize.

 There's ~1.5M more people in the labour force than are employed, compared to a difference of ~1.1M pre-COVID (445k more from May 2019 - April 2025).

From May 2024 - April 2025, there was an increase of this job shortage by 160k, (I expect 130k for 2025). The number of people employed increased by 270k in the last twelve months. For Canada's job market alone (not housing) to be fixed in the next 4 years, hiring would need to increase by 240k/yr (130k + 445k/4). My take is that the government should've reduced immigration further. During 2024, the job shortage actually increased by 240k. The government reduced their immigration targets for 2025 (485,000 in 2024, 395,000 in 2025), and we're seeing the effect almost immediately. The job shortage is increasing at 10k/mo from 20k/mo on average in 2024. Therefore, we need to double the immigration cuts just to keep this job-labour deficit from going out of control.

Since Carney is not running on reducing immigration further, he is essentially promising Canadians that his policies will double economic growth by 2028 which is crazy given that the biggest detriment to it all is their immigration policy! Even if we assumed that Carney doubles housing construction (+250k/yr), that would need to increase the number of people permanently employed by 485,000. Carney is truly a master at politicking!

From my numbers, the government should limit immigration to 240,000 for the next 4 years.A reduction of immigration by at least 160,000 would require increasing economic growth by 33%. According to RBC, every 10% reduction in trade barriers results in 0.2% economic growth per year. Given a GDP growth rate of 1.6 percent (2024), theoretically, even a 30% reduction in trade barriers should suffice. Since Carney wants to also cut government jobs, I'd argue we need to cut immigration by 160,000/yr plus however many public sector jobs are cut per year.
