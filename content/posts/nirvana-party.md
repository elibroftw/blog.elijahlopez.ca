## Principles

- An opportunity for everyone
- Peace from biased actions
- Setting the standards for what it means to be humane

## Policies

### Canada Pension Fund (CPF)

An RRSP alternative for people wanting to save and not worry or give to sun life or whatever.
This fund would be an ETF of Canada's pension plan but with low fees and automatic DRIP.
Funds can be moved from the RRSP to the CPF interchangeably but not very liquid from CPF to RRSP.

### A Stronger CRA

CRA needs to be stronger and have access to more information. People who report 0 income need to be audited more. They pay $0 in taxes and take benefits. They could be earning income in another country and then brining it back to this and there's no records of it except for airplane tickets. If the CRA had access to airport logs, just the thought of tax avoidance by claiming you live in this country would put people back in line.

### Replace Natural Gas Plants with Nuclear

We need to divide each emissions by population for the state to figure out how much CO2/capita in emissions is from natural gas electricity generation.

### Other Policy

See the comment I made on YouTube somewhere

### Zoning

Nationalize zoning, limit the types of zones as much as possible (12 in japan) and maximize the uses of each zone instead of making zones exclusive.
Residential zoning is residential and does not dictate type of building as long as the building is used for housing people. There should be rationale to height limits instead of tradition or an arbitrary base.
