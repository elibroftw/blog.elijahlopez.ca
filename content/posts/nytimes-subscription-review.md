The NYT sucks. Not only did it fail at ensuring there were no biases concerning the reporting on the ongoing war in the Middle East, their technology is hot garbage.

The reason I bought a NYT subscription is because they were offering a heavy discount and I wanted to read an NYC influencer faux lifestyle article.

## The Good

- Some wirecutter articles, which I've used and will use more of

## The Bad

- the front page is always about Israel. I have formed an opinion in private about this situation however my realistic position is that  domestic issues take priority and that foreign issues should be left to God to sort it out in the after life that everyone in that region claims to believe in.
- their lifestyle section is a mess. It's full of junk. They are promoting this post: "She Had Thoughts of Harming Her Baby. To Treat Her, Doctors Kept Them Together."
- It's way too focused on US politics than New York itself, but maybe this will change after the election?

## The Ugly

- incessant popups (those slider page UIs) they would show on mobile of how wonderful the reading experience their app is. Guess what? Although their app has a dark theme, it's full of ads! No thank you.
- What prompted me to write this article is that the NYT website completely froze my desktop firefox browser. I was trying to read a political article reading Latinos in Nevada, and it froze the tab.
