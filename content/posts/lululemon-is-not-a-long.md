summary: "Why Lululemon (LULU) is not a long-term buy for value investors: lacks competitive moat, market saturation, better suited for short-term trading."
---

I originally came to this conclusion in September (12th), but it was sitting in my pinned Google Keep for months. The recent sky rocketing of LULU is just another piece of evidence that the market is irrational. The stock was bleeding for months when I decided it might be time to buy but my investing philosophy at the time was "is it possible to regret my purchase in 10 years." When I invest in stocks, I value peace of mind over maximizing profits. Of course, one way to do that is to invest for a specific time horizon. The other way, which I am going to start implementing is to do the work to arrive at a sell price. That was the strategy to use when it comes to LULU.

The compelling reason that existed to buy LULU is because I thought the Chinese will buy their apparel when their economy recovers (I was proven right as the stock skyrocketed recently on International sales). Even so, I still needed a sell price. And that's the problem. It's impossible for me to arrive at the short-term fair price, so heuristics will need to be used (for future stock considerations). Two heuristics I employ are industry P/E (many issues with P/E) or [historic cashflow yield standard deviations](https://app.koyfin.com/share/e31aae25cd) as seen below.

The reason I didn't purchase LULU in September is because **this is not a buy and hold stock**. Once you go on Instagram, you'll quickly realize that LULU does not actually have a moat and many relatively unknown and yet sizable brands, are also using influencer marketing such as:

- [dfyne](https://www.instagram.com/dfyne.official/)
- [White Fox Boutique](https://www.instagram.com/whitefoxboutique/)

This indicates market saturation and is a red flag to me. This is also why I never bought and do not recommended stocks like Celsius. The good thing about all this research though is that I have a list of luxe-like retailers for the purpose of buying gifts. These companies could make a lot of money if they also started targeting ads at men in relationships.

So investing in retail stocks would usually require very high insight into the market so that you can quickly respond to trends. Sorry, that's not me, but the investment funds that manage billions of dollars in assets could easily pay someone to keep track of these trends for themselves.

Retailer stocks include but are not limited to LULU, ANF, CROX, BBW. The problem I have with these stocks isn't their valuation. They could be undervalued, I'm just saying that these stocks are better valued by actual professional analysts who have more market trend information on their hand than individual investors who can only really buy using **anecdotal, financial, and/or macro analysis**. Micro-economics is an advantage for being an investment banking analyst, but when it's not a full time job, you need to be aware of \[your] bounded rationality.
