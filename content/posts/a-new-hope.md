summary: "I overcome my severe anxiety and achieve mental well-being through worst-case scenario planning (aka Stoicism) and embracing 'artificial stress' for self-improvement."
---

I have never felt better in my life before. For the last month, my mental state has been 10/10 in every aspect. Stability, productivity (to an extent), content, with a vision and short-term goals. Even without a co-op position in my hand, I'm not stressed. I have everything planned out and am loving a life without feeling that ugly kind of stress. Artificial stress is the best kind of stress. Artificial stress is the stress of you telling yourself what to do with a deadline that won't hurt you if you fail to meet it. This way, even if you fail, you know you aren't going to beat yourself up over it. The power and control is all in your hands.

It's very clear that once I accounted for the worst, there's nothing to be anxious about. My anxiety was at a severe level in May, however I was able to push through and got over it in June. It was almost like unraveling a knot of a rope, except it's in your body. Only two days ago I decided to keep improving my life and that is my current goal. To stick on this path of self fulfillment and betterment. I don't want to regret the choices I make, so I will try to reduce risk when making choices.
