I'm currently watching a video called [How recruiters in India use false promises to lure students to Canada - The Fifth Estate](https://youtu.be/dNrXA5m7ROM?si=XbkX2g41OjPPCrmq)

I'm already losing my mind. I don't know how non-Indians feel while watching this, but I absolutely despise the people taking advantage of young Indians.

How can any Canadian in the government and any Indian in India's government and every person in these Canadian institutes even claim they are good people if all they are participating in wealth theft. I'm sorry for my language, but this is fucking gross. When there are millions of fucking Indian students coming into this country and they can't even speak fucking English, and there's 4 Indians per room rented by slumlords (and some are even of the same race as the students), ignorance is not a valid excuse. I knew the problem was bad, but this is a moral failure.

The only thing that the government did was increase the wealth that Indians need to show. Absolutely useless if these students are getting taken advantage of paying $20,000+ for colleges that no one knows of. These students then have to work part time jobs which suppresses wages of Canadians already in poverty without an inheritance or savings.

> Australia, New Zealand, and the UK signed a joint code of conduct for the ethical recruitment of international students to ensure agents are honest, transparent, and act with integrity. Canada chose not to sign on.

This is just one example where Canada is the one who is wrong. In the UK, the secretary of state can single handedly define what organizations are considered to be terrorists. That means that the secretary of state can state that anti-monarchy groups are terrorists. The UK also has the [Online Safety Act](https://www.wired.com/story/the-uks-controversial-online-safety-act-is-now-law/) which is a threat to privacy.

For all the hate that China gets, they were the first to start looking into mobile games.

New Zealand? Imagine being so bad at combating islamophobia that a mass murderer shoots up a mosque. Imagine tolerating Neo-Nazism. Clearly if hate speech leads to actual deaths and you can't predict whether an individual will commit a physical crime, then punish the persuasion.

Sweden? Who do you think the person above referenced? Pewdiepie's anti T-Series video had anti-Indian tropes such as

- "I'm a blue eyes white dragon while you're just dark magician (oof)",
- "hold your defecation (oops)"
- "Your language sounds like it came from a mumble rap community",

Denying that these statements are racist would imply that racism against white people doesn't exist.

You know what. Let me point at some of the retardation of people who think that white supremacists do not exist.

- White europeans are all connected and considered to be the white race / white culture / western culture
  - Not true since Nazi Germans views European White Jews as non-white
  - Not true since Germans after WWII got ethnically cleansed themselves (West and East Germany)
  - Not true since Armenian genocide
  - Not true since Bosnian genocide
  - This is equivalent to saying that 2nd generation Black Americans believe that their culture is all of Africa and that all Black people in Africa are of the same race. It's not true, Rwanda Genocide is an example.
- Believing that white people are being replaced deliberately
- Blaming jews for non-white immigration
- Ethnostate required
- Using dog-whistles; instead of being directly racist, they will promote policies that end up hurting the targeted group and call it good economics since it benefits one race more than the other.
- Fascists will deny they are fascist or racist

The reason that Iran is so hated is because the British did not pay proper royalties to the Iranian government.

> Other ways the Anglo-Persian Oil Company undercut Iranian royalties were selling oil to the British Admiralty at much lower rates, producing no consolidated accounts of the Company’s profits, and only permitting the Iranian government to see the company information the shareholders had access to, which kept the Iranian government from knowing the Company’s true profits.[25](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00263209508701072) Iran’s inability to gain full access to the Company’s books robbed the Iranian government of any possibility of either confirming or dispelling its suspicions concerning the methods by which profits and royalties were calculated,” which further inflamed relations between the two bodies
