I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACanadian/comments/1eypxcp/if_canada_wants_to_increase_the_population_then/) on r/AskACanadian yesterday and I have to say, people in developed countries live in bubbles. I am not ashamed to say that even I lived in a bubble, but at least I am somewhat aware of it, even if not to the same extent as my parents. The bubble is very simple. High fertility is correlated with low real income per capita (PPP)[^1]. First of all, there is a case that the world is overpopulated. I say this only because world leaders like Canada, USA, and Germany are out of touch with the global south. See my [RANT: Climate Change as a Service](/posts/climate-change-as-a-service). Let's assume though that in the future, we have leaders who are global thinkers. Then we can finally have this argument that fertility rates are a problem. So let's first see what an average person would think the solution is to fertility rates by asking the "great" ChatGPT.

> 1. Affordable Housing, Tax Incentives, Childcare Support
> 2. Parental Leave Policies, Flexible Work Arrangements
> 3. Promoting Family-Friendly Culture, Combating Social Pressures:
> 4-9: some other ideas

I'm pleasantly surprised ChatGPT included "Promoting Family-Friendly Culture" because what we'll find out in those countries that go against the grain of higher income = non-replaceable fertility is a culture that promotes having children. You don't actually need money to have children, you need belief that having children is something to not miss on a bucket list, similar to buying a gaming console or a going to that Taylor Swift concert. For example, in Israel, a device is inserted into the anus of dead male soldiers to retrieve their semen. Israel has a culture that prioritizes children over what we would say respecting the dead, and I'm sure that those soldiers consented to that situation beforehand.

The other ideas are naive because people do not actually understand what it means to support them. For example, affordable housing, in other words means that the Greenbelt in Canada should be converted to single family houses, because most Canadians want to live in Single Family Houses. Affordable housing could have meant building family zoned apartments, but modular housing is hailed as the panacea to Gen Z's woes (Millennials could've invested in Bitcoin and the best bull market, so they don't have an excuse). Guess what these modular houses all have in common? That's right, they are mostly just [studio units](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/affordable-housing-developments/modular-housing-initiative/). Give me a break. Triplexes are seen as the middle ground, which I agree with. One of ways I foresee to make money in the future is to invest in a triplex, live in one of the three, and rent out the other two. Doing the math, I'd be paying 4,505.51/month (minimum down payment equal to FHSA) for a $889,995 [triplex](https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/27226833/211-raglan-road-kingston), and renting out 3 rooms at $800 each and one studio for 900, and living in the studio. Therefore, a monthly cash outflow of $1,200 from work.

We should not conclude that income is the only determinant of birth rates since there are clear examples of countries that have achieved the target fertility rate of 2.1 per woman. Let me list the countries and a strong reason why we see this.

## More Notes

Since people have generally done more dying than procreating when in cities, big cities have always depended on rural immigrants to sustain their numbers (source: The Rational Optimist).

I would be against paying people to give birth. I would rather see:

- tax single family homes that don't have people under 31 living in them (pushes density)
- improve workplace conditions so that it's illegal to fire someone for missing work
- allow 2hrs remote work for office jobs if required
  - Not sure what to do about physical labour jobs

Make condos more appealing by prioritizing policing to denser areas, add more natural green spaces on casual daily walks.
