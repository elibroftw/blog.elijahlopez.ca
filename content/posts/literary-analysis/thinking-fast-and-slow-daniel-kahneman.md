## Vocabulary

antecedents: the event immediately prior to something antecedent to my stomach ache

denigrate: unfair critique. Sam denigrated the homeless when he said they deserved it for not paying taxes nor contributing to society.

bias: systemic error

## Introduction to Thinking, Fast and Slow

A book about biases of intuition and how to create diagnoses and labels just like doctors have/do for illnesses.

Amos Tversky was one of the first in decision making research. Kahneman asked him in 1959 to speak at a seminar

A question was proposed. Whether humans are intuitive statisticians just like we are intuitive grammarians. The question lead to a survey proposal to figure out if researchers collect too few observations than necessary to draw conclusions, which lead to the conclusion that statisticians themselves are not intuitive and are not able to properly state how likely a result is to reproduce in a smaller sample. The goal was to judge the intuitive answers and not the actual answers to the statistical questions.

### The Steve Problem

We can describe Steve as a person who resembles the "stereotypical" librarian and ask if Steve is more likely to be a librarian or a farmer. Most people choose librarian even though the ratio of male farmers to male librarians are 20:1. Personally, I did not fall for this trick because the stereotype that librarians are shy is not true, they are very outgoing and are the first to say hello to you.

### The Resemblance Heuristic

The previous study highlights the resemblance rule of thumb that people make use of when asked with a difficult problem which leads to predictable biases. The takeaway here is to be aware of when we are employing this heuristic as to not make important decisions from them.

### Ease of Memory Search

Two questions. One is questioning rate of divorce among professors which triggers searching for people trying to recall whether they know of such a situation. A more formal question is "Is the letter K more likely to appear in words of a text at the start or at the third position." I personally think the third position as I could only think of a handful of words that start with K that are used often versus the word "like" which is even in the sentence! As I read further on, I am vindicated. I'm happy the book has been rubbing off on me.

The bias of the answers is that people are mostly thinking of words starting with the letter K than when K is in third position, so they will exaggerate the frequency of K being in the first position.

### Availability Heuristic

When information pertaining to one situation is shown/presented more often than information pertaining to another, it is easy to place a higher probability on the former situation. The example in the book is that the author challenged his long-standing impression that politicians cheated more often than physicians and lawyers but it turned out his impression was just that and could be due to the choices of journalists. This is a very good topic that Noam Chomsky talks about in his books Manufacturing Consent, Media Control.

This heuristic also applies to what issues the public is vocal about and silent about. For example, vocal about housing crisis, not vocal about male circumcision.

### Expert Intuition is Recognition not Magic

A remarkable feat of intuition, a fire fighter commander yelled to people to get out after they put out a kitchen fire as his ears were hot and fire was quiet so he could tell something was wrong. The floor collapsed soon after the fire fighters got out.

After studying chess master, Herbert Simon determined that the master saw the pieces differently after hours of practice since they could draw on information stored in memory rather than having to think and ponder over a position.

The parallel is drawn to how we are not surprised when a two-year old points to a dog with glee and says "doggie!."

### Not all Expert Intuitions are the Same

There is a stark difference between someone making a decision based on hours of experience and the example in the textbook of a chief investment officer buying shares in Ford because he was impressed at an automobile show he attended. A gut feeling is not the same as expert intuition, although a gut feeling that can be explained via hard facts like "hot ear" is different than the gut feeling based on feelings.

Conclusion by the author is that emotion plays a big role in intuition and the stock picker is an example of the Affect Heuristic; guided by feelings of like and dislike with little to no reasoning/deliberation.

### Intuitive Heuristics

When faced with a difficult question that cannot be answered with intuition based on relevant experience, a similar and  easier question is answered in substitute. When spontaneous thinking fails, slower thinking starts.

### Publishing of the Article

After five years of investigating biases, they published an article on  20 or so heuristics/biases in the Science magazine. The article challenges the broadly held belief that humans are generally rational with normally sound thinking except when it comes to certain emotions (fear, affection, hatred).

## Chapter 1 - Characters in the Story

Highlighted difference between how easy it was to identify a woman's mood based on a glance of the image versus a multiplication problem 17 x 24, which most people are not tuned to answer using intuitive thinking. When doing the problem mentally, we keep the intermediate results in our brain, while our body is strained, and our eys focused. The answer of 408 finally comes after some time.

System 1: operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control

System 2: allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

<details><summary>Some examples of System 1 are provided</summary>

- Detect that one object is more distant than another.
- Orient to the source of a sudden sound.
- Complete the phrase “bread and…”
- Make a “disgust face” when shown a horrible picture.
- Detect hostility in a voice.
- Answer to 2 + 2 = ?
- Read words on large billboards.
- Drive a car on an empty road.
- Find a strong move in chess (if you are a chess master).
- Understand simple sentences.
- Recognize that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail” resembles an occupational stereotype.

<details><summary>System 2 operations share a common feature of attention and being disrupted when attention is drawn away</summary>

- Brace for the starter gun in a race
- Focus attention on the clowns in the circus
- Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room
- Look for a woman with white hair
- Search memory to identify a surprising sound
- Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you
- Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation
- Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text.
- Tell someone your phone number
- Park in a narrow space (for most people except garage attendants)
- Compare two washing machines for overall value.
- Fill out a tax form
- Check the validity of a complex logical argument

Performance of system 2 thinking falters when attention is taken away. Therefore, multi-tasking can only really work when there are no System 2 tasks involved.

Another takeaway is that when driving in an area that is of higher stress, a passenger can easily lower the performance of the driver. Example of the video of the invisible gorilla was given, where the conclusion is that not only can we be blind to what we ought to have seen, we are also blind to the fact that we are blind.

System 1 is running automatically, and system 2 is in low-effort mode. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. System 2 endorses the directive of system 1, these into beliefs or voluntary actions with little modifications. Whereas if System 1 fails, it calls on System 2. System 1 is basically surprised by an event that it determines not to fit in its model. System 2 is also used for continuous monitoring (e.g. polite when angry), and mobilizes when an error is about to occur. The "division of labour" between these systems leads to minimizing effort and maximizing performance. System 1 has biases though and the system cannot be turned off.

### Aside on External Applications of Two Systems

The previous section I read was very good as it made me think of architecture designs when it comes to autonomous artificial intelligence as well as computer chips.

When designing an autonomous agent, we probably want it to also have these two systems. We might want to develop two different networks, somewhat connected, where the first network takes in input and tries to quickly generate something, which is then fed into a second system specialized in correctness, and then a third system depending on if the second system took displeasure.

When designing a chip, since most tasks are system 1 thinking, we want to pack as many efficient cores as possible that focus on minimizing energy usage and maximizing common tasks. For example, a computer is going to be used for two tasks most of the time: browsing the internet (network I/O), some sort of app that makes uses storage (productivity apps). Of course, a computer can also be designed knowing it will be used for a niche tasks more often than the others (e.g. gaming CPUs). So when mass producing these CPUs, 80% will be E cores, while maybe 20% will be performance. The 80-20 rule comes in handy a lot, but it too is a bias.

Obviously, we need to also determine what is the ideal number of cores and that comes down to total ideal energy usage as well as costs. Industry standard is 8 cores for mobile max, but I think 10 cores would be a game changer as two more E-cores can be added while maintaining 2 P-cores.

### Conflict

This section starts by highlighting the difference in our efficiency when we are told to do a task where the contents the task pertains to have related or opposite meaning. The example tasks was read a column of words and whispering the casing of the words. The efficiency is lower when the words themselves are the words that could bew whispered. So when reading upper, you whisper lower, and when reading LOWER you whisper upper. Conclusion: system 2 is in charge of self control.

### Illusions

![Müller-Lyer illusion](https://how-emotions-are-made.com/w/images/heam/b/b7/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion.png)

The horizontal lines are in fact equal but you should've seen this illusion or some form of it enough time by the time you are 22 years old.

Even though we know that the lengths are equal, we still see that the bottom is longer, and this is system 1 at work. Although we can teach ourselves to ignore line length comparison when fins are attached, we cannot override system 1 thinking, for some reason.

It does seem that AI can be fed a lot of system 2 thinking without hindering what I call the system 1 thinking. So our own perception of what system 1 cannot overcome, can definitely be overcome by AI in a similar response time.

Cognitive Illusions. Apparently the professor of psychology at one of the lectures the author attended said therapists will meet a patient who claims this time will be different and how previous therapists have failed him and the professor says this person is most likely a psychopath so to skip them; Psychopathic charm. I don't get it though. As a therapist, can't you just use a psychopath for research then? Do moral psychopaths not exist? Plus you get paid anyways. Also some patients probably are hard on themselves and exaggerate the inefficacy of therapists.

Avoiding tedious effort, we should aim to learn to recognize when mistakes are more likely to be made and avoid significant mistakes in serious situations, as I mentioned earlier.
