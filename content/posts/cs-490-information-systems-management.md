Why are we building things.

System: components

Ahmed Ibrahim: DC 2133 (Tuesday, Thursday after lecture)

### The First System

For 4000 years, writing was the only information technnology

Data vs. Information

data: raw facts before organization into an understandable form

information: data that has been shaped into a meaningful and useful form for human beings

### Business Transformation

- automation and digitization
- data-driven decision-making
- enhanced customer engagement
- improved collaboration and connectivity
- disruption of traditional industries through new business models

### Information Systems Management

What are we doing after we build a system.

#### Advantages

- Survival
- Competitive advantages

#### Success

Correct tech, tools, processes, people, networks

### Problems with Manual reservations

- Difficult to match passenger names to seats
- Resulted in poorly managed inventory (i.e., seats on a fight)
  - Over-booking: dissatisfied customers
  - Under-booking: lost revenue
- Aircraft with greater seating capacity and greater frequency of use on the horizon
  - More inventory and passengers to keep track of

- Introduction of Sabre:
  - Reduced man power
  - American airlines - IBM
  - Remote terminals

### Waves of Innovation

- cut costs
- generate revenue
- business survival

### Software Architecture

- architecture (conceptual)
  - blueprint
  - implementation independent
- infrastructure (physical)
  - implementation dependent
  - physical material

#### Reference Architecture

- captures main components
- high level abstraction
- common vocabulary
- comparative

#### Architectural Styles

- broad perspective on how to structure our
software application

- Component-based
- Layered
- Pipes and filters
- Microkernel
- Client/server
- Event-driven
- Repository

#### Monolithic

- tightly coupled
- single large code base
- less scalable

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- reusable and interoperable via service interfaces
- common interface standards

#### Microservice Architecture

- single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and actions
- small teams own entire life cycle of the service
- The term “micro” refers to the sizing of a service which must be
manageable by a single development team (5 to 10 developers).
