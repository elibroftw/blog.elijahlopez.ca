Since my [yt-dlp propaganda on YouTube is getting many views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq9qpA2QOTI), I thought I'd create this article and a future video on how to use yt-dlp to download audio from websites, primarily YouTube.

## Installing yt-dlp

Following the [official instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation)

## Installing ffmpeg

- Windows 10+: `winget install ffmpeg`
  - If winget is not installed, you can install it [from here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1)
- [Linux](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux)
- [MacOS](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac)

## Downloading Audio

You can try using `yt-dlp` before resorting to `python -m yt_dlp` like I did. In my case I installed yt-dlp with Python's pip because yt-dlp is embedded in my music player, [Music Caster](https://github.com/elibroftw/music-caster/#readme).

```sh
python -m yt_dlp <URL> -xciw -f "bestaudio/best" --audio-quality 0 --audio-format mp3 --embed-thumbnail --embed-metadata -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s"
```

If the video doesn't have the artist in the title, use the following output template instead: `-o "%(creator,uploader,channel)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"`

### Example

If you are using yt-dlp on youtube videos, you can either supply the URL or just the ID.

```sh
python -m yt_dlp UTwB8iJOux0 -xciw -f "bestaudio/best" --audio-quality 0 --audio-format mp3 --embed-thumbnail --embed-metadata -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s"
# python -m yt_dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTwB8iJOux0&pp=ygUVc2V3ZXJzbHZ0IGFsbCB0aGUgam95 -xciw -f "bestaudio/best" --audio-format mp3 --embed-thumbnail --embed-metadata -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s"
```

## Metadata Editing

![Downloaded File Metadata in Music Caster](/images/yt-dlp/music-caster-metadata-before-edit.png)

yt-dlp is not smart enough to add all metadata nor the correct album cover, so if you are on Windows, you can use [Music Caster](https://github.com/elibroftw/music-caster/#readme) to further edit the metadata and add the correct cover art.
