Provincial and Federal combined.

Bracket 1: 0% up to minimum expenditure to survive (rent, groceries, internet, phone plan, 1 MacBook Air 512GB+ or Lenovo yoga slim 7i 512GB+ amortized over 4 years, 1 just below flag ship phone model amortized over 4 years - either iPhone base model or the android equivalent, add $200 medication, add $150/mo in discretionary spending, add $100/mo for transportation - bus). Therefore I'd say 35,000. Ideally minimum wage is equivalent to this amount and thus indexed. That way there's no issues in figuring out who is poor and who isn't poor. For some reason both levels of government are taxing $300/mo more than they should be! Cpp and EI is 2300 however I'm sure with the GST rebate, the carbon tax rebate, and the trillium benefit, that money comes back!

Bracket 2: 11% income attainable upon joining the workforce. So probably 90k

Bracket 3: 22% up to 230k

Bracket 4: 33% beyond 230k

A tax system should assume a person has children. It should enable people to have children without needing to report to the government that they have children. A proper tax system should also allow income splitting via marriage so that a two people living together earning 160k together versus a single person earning 160k with a non working partner pay the same amount of taxes.

We also need to encourage families. That means bigger units should not be rent controlled so that the private sector builds these units. Rent control should only be for studios and under 600 square feet units.

Corporations should be taxed according to how many people they employ. It should be based on a function of minimum wage. So for example, take corporation A who earns $100B and corporation B who earns $100B but corporation A hires 1000 people whereas corporation B hires 100. According to logic, corporation A has contributed more to the country. Therefore, corporation A should actually receive a tax break. Or in other words, taxes should be raised on corporations and then corporations are given tax breaks depending on their employees. There should be a target of employees to earning to meet. For example, anything more than $1m/employee should be taxed higher because it shows that the corporation is not investing enough in R&D. Sure we have R&D credits, but clearly taxes on corporations aren't high enough then.

Towards a Split Rate Tax

Canada needs to grow more. Compared to the US, real GDP in Canada has only recently surpassed its previous high, albeit only by a small margin.

Additionally, a high real GDP could be due to sales of higher priced real estate rather than new developments, new services, and production.

It's imperative to embrace the service economy and if in the ideal world we would work less and experience more, then it follows that the demand for services is tied to the price to experience. In other words, I believe that services are elastic in nature and that lower prices will lead to higher gdp . Obviously prices can't just fall. Businesses are started based on if they can beat the S&P500 over a period of time. So the stock market crashes, more businesses will be started as where else will the capital go?

But starting a business has significant costs, especially if the business is going to be physical rather than digital. A digital business can be started anywhere anytime at low costs but digital experiences cannot be shared with other people the same way a physical experience can.

Renters should pay less taxes for owning less land

Rental expenses should be tax deductible for individual renters since their payment does not acquire equity in the property. When market price is high, land lords earn income. When market price is low, land lords can reduce incur a rental loss to offset their other income. Renters do not get this benefit. They pay the same tax regardless of the amount of money they spend on housing. This is a ridiculous benefit. The tax system should not punish or harm people that have less resources. Renters do have less resources because otherwise, they could pay to own rather than pay to rent.

The Problem of a Generalized Capital Gains Tax

It's looking at the wrong problem. Elon Musk has not ruined millions of people's lives, the lack of labour competition is what let Elon Musk get so rich. If there were 100 smart people rather than 1 smart person competing for a fixed size pool of labourers, then all those labourers will inadvertently get pulled up. Although capitalism has its flaws (e.g. all taxable capital gains sources are treated as equal even though they are not equal). Selling a business you became an owner of (founders) > Selling shares of a business you contributed to as a minority shareholder (VC) >= Selling shares of an IPO you bought into > Selling shares on the secondary market, which because time is wealth, required almost no "work."

## Ethics of Taxes

Warning: this is a brain dump without editing

A lot of people believe that taxes should be increased just because tax revenue will increase. This is no different from capitalists paying minimum wage just because they can get away with such a low cost or
slavers trading and using slaves just because they can. It's not a logical argument because it completely disregards morals and ethics.

### Reasoning of Taxation

What is the point of taxes? Tax is used to function function a society, or a nation. Therefore, taxes should be set at a level that covers the functions of a nation.

### Ethical Taxation

Ethical taxation is taxing without reasonable discrimination. Discriminatory taxation means taxing a citizen more than the other due to prejudice or envy and not based on improving society for everyone.

One such taxation policy would be Canada's luxury tax. The tax applies to cars over 100,000 and planes or boats over 250,000.
Why is this tax unethical? It's unethical because it punishes citizens for having different spending tastes and isn't taxing based on real wealth.
A person buying a $100,000 car could most definitely be using money that would otherwise have gone to housing in a more popular area. This tax policy
basically promotes the opposite of housing affordability because people's reasonable material wants are being taxed.

The case for progressive taxes is that the cost to live is a certain number so to benefit society, its better that the lower income people have an easier time attaining an affordable lifestyle.
Since progressive tax rates just means difference in tax on additional units, there isn't much discrimination since everyone is paying the same tax till the cost of living.

What progressive tax rates shouldn't do however is dissuade people from working harder in the short-term so that they can benefit in the long term. I think 2.5x the median income is a good gauge.
Double means that one person can accommodate two people, and the extra .5 is a buffer for different areas.

I also think ethical taxation means making tax payable to a single entity. So for a federated place, the provincial government should be responsible for paying taxes to the federal.
The province can collect the taxes and the federal government charges each province per person. This way the federal government can't discriminate individuals in their taxing policies.

## Functions of a Nation

- education: giving each citizen the means to live
- welfare: giving each citizen a hand when they get unlucky
- defence: giving each citizen peace of mind in their day to day lives (internal and external threats)
- pooled benefits: things that only a few citizens **require** but cost insane amount
  - Healthcare (services as well as medicine)
    - Cosmetic surgeries should not be funded unless there is serious quality of life improvements (e.g. nose job, mole removal, laser eye surgery)
  - natural disaster insurance and services
- regulations: giving each citizen protection from the consequences of their own and others' actions
  - cigarettes
  - drinking and driving
  - alcohol
  - hard drugs
  - guns (gun liberty strongly depends on the quality of policing; if policing and laws do not protect citizens, guns are good, otherwise guns aren't useful)
    - of course some guns are for sport, so for sport, the government should designate enough gun use areas
- permitting collective resources
  - each citizen should be compensated for not owning their right to collective resource
    - put simply, if you are using more resources than the amount of resources that the share each citizen basically owns through the government, you should pay more
      - private property is a permit to use certain land in exchange for collective benefits
      - if you don't get collective benefits, then there's no permits either (e.g. sovereignty)
  - collective resources include land, radio waves, air (maybe), water, minerals

I believe I got most of the functions of the government, but I probably need to do more research.

Some of these functions can be funded on a use case basis. For example, if there is a behaviour (driving cars)
that costs the government more to provide than if people didn't drive cars, the people of that behaviour should be
paying more for their fair share. This is different from luxury taxes where the government is not spending more to provide luxury cars than non-luxury cars
whereas governments are spending money to provide roads used by drivers. If there were less drivers there would be less need to spend on roads.
People who take public transportation are saving the government money, therefore a higher share of the cost of the roads should be paid by car owners rather
than public transportation users. In other words, all roads should be tolled if reasonable public transport alternatives exist. So say the main highway that runs
along the GO train. No I don't believe it should be taxed because public transport is slower by more than an hour. If public transportation can get you to a location with
a time difference of no more than 30 minutes to an hour max, then a case for taxation can be made.
