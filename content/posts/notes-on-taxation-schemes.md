Provincial and Federal combined.

Bracket 1: 0% up to minimum expenditure to survive (rent, groceries, internet, phone plan, 1 MacBook Air 512GB+ or Lenovo yoga slim 7i 512GB+ amortized over 4 years, 1 just below flag ship phone model amortized over 4 years - either iPhone base model or the android equivalent, add $200 medication, add $150/mo in discretionary spending, add $100/mo for transportation - bus). Therefore I'd say 35,000. Ideally minimum wage is equivalent to this amount and thus indexed. That way there's no issues in figuring out who is poor and who isn't poor. For some reason both levels of government are taxing $300/mo more than they should be! Cpp and EI is 2300 however I'm sure with the GST rebate, the carbon tax rebate, and the trillium benefit, that money comes back!

Bracket 2: 11% income attainable upon joining the workforce. So probably 90k

Bracket 3: 22% up to 230k

Bracket 4: 33% beyond 230k

A tax system should assume a person has children. It should enable people to have children without needing to report to the government that they have children. A proper tax system should also allow income splitting via marriage so that a two people living together earning 160k together versus a single person earning 160k with a non working partner pay the same amount of taxes.

We also need to encourage families. That means bigger units should not be rent controlled so that the private sector builds these units. Rent control should only be for studios and under 600 square feet units.

Corporations should be taxed according to how many people they employ. It should be based on a function of minimum wage. So for example, take corporation A who earns $100B and corporation B who earns $100B but corporation A hires 1000 people whereas corporation B hires 100. According to logic, corporation A has contributed more to the country. Therefore, corporation A should actually receive a tax break. Or in other words, taxes should be raised on corporations and then corporations are given tax breaks depending on their employees. There should be a target of employees to earning to meet. For example, anything more than $1m/employee should be taxed higher because it shows that the corporation is not investing enough in R&D. Sure we have R&D credits, but clearly taxes on corporations aren't high enough then.

Towards a Split Rate Tax

Canada needs to grow more. Compared to the US, real GDP in Canada has only recently surpassed its previous high, albeit only by a small margin.

Additionally, a high real GDP could be due to sales of higher priced real estate rather than new developments, new services, and production.

It's imperative to embrace the service economy and if in the ideal world we would work less and experience more, then it follows that the demand for services is tied to the price to experience. In other words, I believe that services are elastic in nature and that lower prices will lead to higher gdp . Obviously prices can't just fall. Businesses are started based on if they can beat the S&P500 over a period of time. So the stock market crashes, more businesses will be started as where else will the capital go?

But starting a business has significant costs, especially if the business is going to be physical rather than digital. A digital business can be started anywhere anytime at low costs but digital experiences cannot be shared with other people the same way a physical experience can.

Renters should pay less taxes for owning less land

Rental expenses should be tax deductible for individual renters since their payment does not acquire equity in the property. When market price is high, land lords earn income. When market price is low, land lords can reduce incur a rental loss to offset their other income. Renters do not get this benefit. They pay the same tax regardless of the amount of money they spend on housing. This is a ridiculous benefit. The tax system should not punish or harm people that have less resources. Renters do have less resources because otherwise, they could pay to own rather than pay to rent.

The Problem of a Generalized Capital Gains Tax

It's looking at the wrong problem. Elon Musk has not ruined millions of people's lives, the lack of labour competition is what let Elon Musk get so rich. If there were 100 smart people rather than 1 smart person competing for a fixed size pool of labourers, then all those labourers will inadvertently get pulled up. Although capitalism has its flaws (e.g. all taxable capital gains sources are treated as equal even though they are not equal). Selling a business you became an owner of (founders) > Selling shares of a business you contributed to as a minority shareholder (VC) >= Selling shares of an IPO you bought into > Selling shares on the secondary market, which because time is wealth, required almost no "work."
