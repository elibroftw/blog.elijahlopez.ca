## [Arab Wikipedia blackout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2023-12-24/Discussion_report)

 People who only knew Arabic were forced to not be able to read the Arabic wikipedia nor were they able to edit it. Instead they were forced to read a solidarity for Palestine, a cause they most likely support but realistically could not do anything about it.
