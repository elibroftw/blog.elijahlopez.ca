summary: "This post, 'Glossary - Software Engineering Handbook,' provides definitions for key terms used throughout the handbook. It defines terms such as application, coupled, libraries, network request, server, tech stack, tech debt, and piping, offering concise explanations to help readers understand the terminology used in software engineering."
---

_application_: an application can be anything that would exist digitally/virtually and does some sort of interactivity. For example, Jill is writing an application that tracks car price data from various sources on the internet

_coupled_: a set of closely grouped things, usually features when using the term for software development

_libraries_: coupled functionality that has been already programmed and abstracted for the programmer to use

_network request_: exchange of information over cables via internet protocols (DNS, IP, TCP/UDP). A full-fledged networks course is needed to learn more.

_server_: a server is a physical computing device that is responsible for processing some sort of network request

_tech stack_: a group of programming tools/languages that works cohesively to produce a deliverable

_tech debt_: code that is less than ideal and is more difficult to maintain than it should be

_piping_: imagine you have two processes with each of their own input and output channels. Piping can refer to connecting their IO streams. For example, `command1 | command2` demonstrates piping the output of command1 into the input of command2
