summary: "This post, 'Chapter 8 - Continuous Integration' of 'The Software Engineering Handbook,' introduces Continuous Integration (CI) as a software development practice. It covers the purpose of CI, common CI tools and platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps), and the key components of a CI pipeline, including automated builds, testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), code analysis (linting, static analysis), and artifact generation. The chapter emphasizes the benefits of CI for improving code quality, reducing integration issues, and enabling faster feedback loops."
