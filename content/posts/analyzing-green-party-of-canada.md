## Sustainability

[Sustainability](https://www.greenparty.ca/en/green-values/sustainability)

> We recognise that sustainability will not be possible as long as poverty persists.

### Limiting Consumption of "the Rich"

The green party states that they want to limit the consumption of the rich so that poor people can also consume the Earth's (they spell earth) resources, but the green party fails to define what rich is!

The median wealth of Canadians is ~US$500,000 and the median household in some cities are millionaires in this economy.

The green party think the population growth crisis stems from Canada and not foreign countries.

> achieving greater resource and energy efficiency and development and use of environmentally sustainable technologies

What kind of technologies are considered environmentally sustainable?
