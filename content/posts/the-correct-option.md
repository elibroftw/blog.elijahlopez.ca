Given thousands of arguments where the most sound
arguments are in fact required, how do we do it?

For the simplest topics, a survey is enough. e.g. favorite ice cream would fit this bill.
For topics where there are only a few answers, comparison is pretty easy to do. e.g. which video sharing platform is the best.

However, these techniques fail to address complex topics where people are often subjecated to
violence, harassment, bullying, and death threats. Mob mentality rules these waters, and
as all know, "democracy is never wrong. Google told me so 😏"

If you can't detect my sarcasm, I hold the opinion that democracy has a crticial failure point.
And when I say democracy, I mean the concept of the majority changing/removing/adding
**any** laws. Countries like the USA are republics meaning there are checks on the government.
Checks on the government means that 51% of the population is not able to dictate the lives of the other 49%.
In the USA, there needs to be 66% to 75% agreeability before the consitution can be changed.
It is important to note this distinction as governments are not run based on what is trending on Twitter.

My proof for those who think this opionion is controversial is very simple;
Before and during Galileo's time (an astronomer alive in the 16-17th century), people of modern day Italy believed the Sun revolved around the Earth and went so far as to kill a man for his opinion based on hard evidence that the Earth revolved around the Sun.
I don't think humans have evolved to become more or less intelligent during this time, simply that we have access to more information.
However, this article is precisely about having too much information. Democracy does not gurantee truth.

So what is my solution? [Open-debate platform](/posts/open-debate-platform)
