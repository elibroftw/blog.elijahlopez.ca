It's very frustrating to argue with the uneducated masses. So I've made this blog post, which will hopefully be made into a nice tiktok video

When new homes are cheaper for all primary home buyers, and not just first-time home buyers, more existing home owners will buy new houses and move into them, thus vacating their older homes. These older homes will be cheaper to buy than new homes (due to more depreciation, and assuming the new house is of similar quality or higher). These vacated and older homes will increase the supply of homes that are within the price range of most first time home buyers. Thus, a GST cut for all primary home buyers is better than a GST cut exclusively for first time home buyers. I hope this helps in explaining my viewpoint!
