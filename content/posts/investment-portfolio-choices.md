When people talk about portfolio weighting, there's usually only three that people are taught: market capitalization, price, equal.

But what is ideal? We know price is not ideal because it's based on the share price which is determined by the shares outstanding. With market price and equal weight, it's a bit harder. Usually equal weight is better, but clearly, the top stocks (tech) of the S&P500 has made the market weighted index outperform the equal weighted index. Therefore, we need an equal weighted portfolio where the weight of the heavy weights are bigger than if they were in the SP500 market-weighted index.
