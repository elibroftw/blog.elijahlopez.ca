As some people may know, I care about privacy to the degree that convenience is not sacrificed. That means that when it comes to becoming wealthy versus maximizing privacy, I will choose becoming wealthy. That is one reason why I stick to Windows. As a few of you know, I have two degrees, one is in Computer Science, and the other is in Business Administration, with a concentration in finance

I actively manage my portfolio, and am willing to short companies I think are overvalued. When creating a short list of companies to buy, I want to make use of Excel's feature.

I calculate my net worth every month. I don't know any other person who does that. I write down a rationale for why my net worth went up or went down m/m.

The last thing I want to worry about when doing this on a spreadsheet, is the visual being off, the stock functionality being missing, and worse, the numbers being straight up wrong (these are three issues I've had with LibreOffice).

For that reason, I bought Microsoft 365 Family. I'm not poor, I can afford it. Microsoft 365 Family comes with 1TB of OneDrive storage, so why would I spend money on Mega Sync?

To daily drive Fedora, I would have to take care of a few things right off the bat.

1. OneDrive support
2. Using Excel
3. Setting up QEMU to run Windows 11 so I can use Excel but also for Gaming
4.Using Microsoft ToDo

Why wouldn't I spend that time? Oh well here's what else that's on my mind:

- How to run a mayoral election
- Reading more books
- Attending more social events
- Contributing to some open source projects
- Swimming more

## Privacy Pack

- Payments
  - Monero
    - How to acquire Monero?
      1. Kraken
      2. Coinbase USDC + Trocador (swap is pseudonymous since your USDC address is linked to you through Coinbase)
      3. Haveno (no KYC, identity known only to the parties involved in each trade)
  - fallback: BTC Lightning
    - Buy from any crypto exchange
- VPN
  1. Obscura, the first VPN that **cannot** know which sites you visit! A traditional VPN is like an ISP, it offers no privacy, only location spoofing plus circumvention of network surveillance & rules
  2. Like Obscura, no email required, you can pay with Monero
- Anonymous Browsing
  - The Onion Router
- Email
  1. Tutanota (because you can pay with Monero indirectly)
  2. ProtonMail (2nd only because you can't pay with Monero yet)
- Twitter alternatives
  - TODO: Need extensions to redirect before hitting twitter.com
