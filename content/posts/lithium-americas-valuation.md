NOTE: $ is in the USD denomination

Recently, Lithium Americas announced a share issuance of 55,000,000 shares for a total of 250,000,000 ($5/share). The first part values the company using efficient market hypothesis. The second part is a quasi-dividend discount model.

## Valuing Based on Efficient Market Hypothesis

Fair price of $4.97. Upside of 30 cents of 8% on top of required rate of return.

```txt
Price Before Announcement = $6.66
Shares outstanding before = 162.16M
Market Cap Before = $6.66 * 162.16 = 1,080M
Shares added = 55M
Shares outstanding present = 217.16
Price Ceteris Paribus = $4.97
Upside 0.37 cents per share or 8% based on recent after close pricing.
```

Commentary: This is more of a question on whether the market will figure out that LAC is trading at a discount. I remember when PBR dropped 11%+ and it came back up for the dividend. I sold it before the CEO was replaced.

## Valuing Based on Future Dividend Distributions

Lithium Americas is fairly valued at \[4.43, 4.9] using conservative assumptions.

A rough valuation was done using conservative assumptions:

- 192.9 Mega ton of proven reserves equivalent to 3.3 mega tons of Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3)
- Price per ton: US $5,400
  - Once the Thacker Pass is operational, selling at a price higher than this lower bound will draw returns over 10% on the investment
- Useful life: 40 years
  - Although production will be smaller in the earlier years and double in the later years, we will assume a smoothened annuity
- Mining net profit margin = 7%
  - Net profit margins vary between the years and can be as high as 20% or as low as -7%. Better to pick a number that makes sense in the long-term. 7% could be an over-estimate, but if mining corporations were known to have low net profit margins, the market would be valuing it a significantly less
- Discount rate of 10%

Profit Annuity = 3.3 \* 1000000 \* 5400 \* 0.07 / 40 = $31,185,000 per year

Using the annuity formula, we get a present value of 304,959,697. The PV is a year before the plant becomes operational. We will assume 2025, but the longer it takes, the longer we will under-perform the  market.

Add back Net Tangible Assets of 407,462,000

Plus the Cash infusion of $250,000,000

Fair Value = 712,421,697 + 250,000,000
= 962,421,697

Divided by shares outstanding of 217.16M and we get US $4.43, which is only 4% less than the last price of $4.60 and 6% less than the last closing price.

Since the fair value price at the end of the year is higher than the current price, the current price is fair.

### Recommendation

Using EMH, LAC is a buy. After a valuation, the risk is if Phase 1 will be passed, which is likely given the $250,000,000 cash infusion. Since the stock is valued fairly using safe assumptions, LAC is a buy for risk-seekers. For the risk-averse, fair-value without profits can never be a buy.
