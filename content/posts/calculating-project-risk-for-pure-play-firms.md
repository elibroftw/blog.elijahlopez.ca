summary: "This post discusses the inadequacy of using a firm-wide WACC for evaluating diverse projects. It highlights that a firm's Beta reflects its overall operations, not individual project risks or capital structures. Relying solely on firm WACC can lead to misjudging project viability (IRR vs. WACC) due to inaccurate equity risk assessment for specific ventures."

A firm can take part in many different projects and these projects might not be the same or have the same capital structure associated with them. If only the firm-wide WACC is used, some projects may appear worthy if their IRR is above the WACC and some projects may appear unworthy if their IRR is less than the WACC. However, there is no guarantee that these projects are using the right equity risk or beta since the firm's Beta represents all of what the firm does not just one type of project.
