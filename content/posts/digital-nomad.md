## Criteria

This is a blog post that summarizes my digital nomad research. All prices in USD.

- Rent under $1,500
- Warm climate (no snow)
- Daily swimming
- Ideally within the Eastern Timezone or Central European Standard Time
- Not the USA
- Cheap flights to places where it snows

## Tour One

After doing enough research, for my first tour, I prefer Europe to South East Asia due to the timezone differences. It was a debate between Portugal and Spain, however I decided to go with Spain because Spanish is probably more important to learn than Portuguese, it was closer to central Europe, and there's way more cities to travel to. As for the cities, I wanted a city on the East Coast that I can fly directly to. I went with Magaluf, Majorca. See [Magaluf, Majorca 2025](/posts/magaluf-majorca-2025) for my plan and hopefully journal.
