Answer: yes.

To properly answer this question (in the long-form), we need to define "over-population of humans." The definition is more humans than the ideal amount for maximizing standard of living. This is the definition I'll be using.

Let's now define the acceptable standard of living:

- A 24 year old or older human who is able to work should be able to live on a floor of a housing unit by him or herself or rents the floor with one other person. That is a floor per pair or family of human beings.
  - Sub-points:
    - The following sub-points are reasons for affordability. Either the parent covenant or the children need to be satisfied
    - A 24 year old human being should be able to walk <15 minutes to and from a grocery store
    - Close to work without requiring an automobile
- A 24 year old or older human should be able to utilize their skill-set for jobs that are deemed to be in demand.
  - For example, I have software engineering talent, which is an in-demand job, yet job postings are all asking for senior or 5+ yoe developers. Yes an exception can be made for me, as I even programmed my own Music Player.

Affordability is defined as:

Resources required to apply and obtain for the job (e.g. internet, phone, laundry, shower/gym membership) plus resources required to perform job as expected. Even then, a human who is living to work and not living to enjoy life in the spare time, is a human whose life is below ideal. So we need to throw in time and social costs: 10 hours during the weekdays and 24 hours for each weekend excluding sleep. So 34 hours per week in free-time.

As humans, we should not be living to work but living to enjoy life and spread prosperity. That is why I embrace automation. What a world we could live in if we just had people working in vital areas such as healthcare, maintenance, automation-infrastructure, government.

We should probably define why life is worth living even if it is "self-evident." **Dopamine**. Humans naturally release dopamine and this is the reason life is worth living. Humans who do not release dopamine will suffer consequences so it is vital to restore dopamine functionality, otherwise it will lead to a morality rabbit hole. In other words, a human who does not carry for their own life has no reason to care of someone else's life and if they do not apply morals to themselves, we cannot expect them to apply morals to other human beings.

I GIVE UP WRITING THIS ARTICLE. IT IS POINTLESS.
