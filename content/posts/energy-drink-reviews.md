What ratings mean. Anything above 5 means I would rather drink it than drink nothing. Anything under 6 means I'd rather drink water. Anything at 0 is a no go even if thirsty. I've sorted the drinks based on which I believe tastes the best. When this page is longer, I suggest using the find on page feature of your browser if you are looking for a specific review.

### Reign Energy White Gummy Bear (9 / 10)

I believe this is better than the Razzle Berry flavour, but I will have to taste again. There isn't exactly any bad points I can think of. This does have a slight taste like a gummy bear and it's not overpowering.

### Reign Energy Razzle Berry (8 / 10)

The first energy drink that had a good taste that persuaded me to buy another one. This is great and it's only downfall is this slight after taste that lingers. I forget exactly what that "bad" taste is, but I'll update this article the next time I drink it. Rated 8 / 10 because I'm saving the perfect score until I've tasted and reviewed at least 10 energy drinks.

### Monster Camo (8 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here.

### Monster White (8 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here.

### Reign Storm Grape (8 / 10)

Had this once, it's good.

### Reign Storm Kiwi Blend (8 / 10)

Had this once, it's good. Too many 8/10s though, so I'll have to retest them to figure out which ones are better.

### Reign Energy Reignbow Sherbet (6 / 10)

This definitely is not on par with White Monster. It doesn't taste as good as I thought it did, so it's not worth a repurchase. However, if someone offered me to drink it, I would accept.
I'll try to drink my last can chilled to figure out if the subpar taste was just because the drink was at room temperature.

### Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle (5 / 10)

I will admit that I am a prejudice person when it comes to goods and services, however I am open minded because without having an open-mind, you can never push your own definition of perfection. I was biased against the Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle because why would I want to taste Orange when I have orange juice?
I said why not because what if it would be better than Orange juice. I was wrong, it smells and tastes like medicine. Never buying again.

### Reign Energy Cherry Limeade (2 / 10)

Disgusting. And by disgusting I mean not my cup of tea.
