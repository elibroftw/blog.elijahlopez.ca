What ratings mean. Anything above 5 means I would rather drink it than drink nothing. Anything under 6 means I'd rather drink water. Anything at 0 is a no go even if thirsty. I've sorted the drinks based on which I believe tastes the best. When this page is longer, I suggest using the find on page feature of your browser if you are looking for a specific review.

### Reign Energy White Gummy Bear (9 / 10)

I believe this is better than the Razzle Berry flavour, but I will have to taste again. There isn't exactly any bad points I can think of. This does have a slight taste like a gummy bear and it's not overpowering.

### Reign Storm Grape (8.5 / 10)

I like the taste of this better than Monster White, so that's why it's getting an 8.5. I'll have the White Gummy Bear soon to compare exactly which drink gets first place. One great and underrated aspect about the Reign Storm brand is that the caffeine level is low enough to have two cans per day! The downside is that the can is actually smaller than the Reign Energy and Monster cans, however I have trouble finishing those cans anyways, sometimes taking up to 3 hours to finish a can. I recommend drinking this cold or with ice for better taste.

### Reign Energy Razzle Berry (8 / 10)

The first energy drink that had a good taste that persuaded me to buy another one. This is great and it's only downfall is this slight after taste that lingers. I forget exactly what that "bad" taste is, but I'll update this article the next time I drink it. Rated 8 / 10 because I'm saving the perfect score until I've tasted and reviewed at least 10 energy drinks.

### Monster Camo (8 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here.

### Monster White (8 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here.

### Reign Storm Kiwi Blend (8 / 10)

Had this once, it's good. Too many 8/10s though, so I'll have to retest them to figure out which ones are better.

### Reign Energy Reignbow Sherbet (6 / 10)

This definitely is not on par with White Monster. It doesn't taste as good as I thought it did, so it's not worth a repurchase. However, if someone offered me to drink it, I would accept.
I'll try to drink my last can chilled to figure out if the subpar taste was just because the drink was at room temperature.

### Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle (5 / 10)

I will admit that I am a prejudice person when it comes to goods and services, however I am open minded because without having an open-mind, you can never push your own definition of perfection. I was biased against the Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle because why would I want to taste Orange when I have orange juice?
I said why not because what if it would be better than Orange juice. I was wrong, it smells and tastes like medicine. Never buying again.

### Reign Energy Cherry Limeade (2 / 10)

Disgusting. And by disgusting I mean not my cup of tea.
