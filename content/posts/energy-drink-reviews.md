What ratings mean. Anything above 5 means I would rather drink it than drink nothing. Anything under 6 means I'd rather drink water. Anything at 0 is a no go even if thirsty. I've sorted the drinks based on which I believe tastes the best. When this page is longer, I suggest using the find on page feature of your browser if you are looking for a specific review.

### Reign Energy White Gummy Bear (9 / 10)

I believe this is better than the Razzle Berry flavour, but I will have to taste the razzle berry again. There isn't exactly any bad points I can think of. This does have a slight taste like a gummy bear and it's not overpowering.

I like this a lot. It definitely deserves the #1 spot.

### Celsius Sparkling Arctic Vibe (8.9 / 10)

It's pretty good too, but it gets over so quickly compared to the C4 and Monster White.

### C4 Frozen Bombsicle (8.9 / 10)

The negative is that it doesn't really taste like an energy drink, more like juice.

### Reign Storm Grape (8.5 / 10)

I like the taste of this better than Monster White, so that's why it's getting an 8.5. I'll have the White Gummy Bear soon to compare exactly which drink gets first place. One great and underrated aspect about the Reign Storm brand is that the caffeine level is low enough to have two cans per day! The downside is that the can is actually smaller than the Reign Energy and Monster cans, however I have trouble finishing those cans anyways, sometimes taking up to 3 hours to finish a can. I recommend drinking this cold or with ice for better taste.

### Reign Energy Razzle Berry (8 / 10)

The first energy drink that had a good taste that persuaded me to buy another one. This is great and it's only downfall is this slight after taste that lingers. I forget exactly what that "bad" taste is, but I'll update this article the next time I drink it. Rated 8 / 10 because I'm saving the perfect score until I've tasted and reviewed at least 10 energy drinks.

### Reign Storm Kiwi Blend (8 / 10)

Had this once, it's good. Too many 8/10s though, so I'll have to retest them to figure out which ones are better.

### Celsius Tropical Vibe (8 / 10)

Tag line: _Sparkling Starfruit, Pineapple Flavour_

A new entrant to the 8/10s. For drinks rated 8+, I suggest applying a round robin to enjoy the variety of flavours.

A lot of people say that the bilingual label increases costs and hurts competition but I digress. Celsius went as far as to even localize the word flavour.
Not to mention some energy drinks are cheaper in Canada after doing a simple USD to CAD conversion.
Maybe that's just due to Canadians having lower purchasing power but oh well.

### Monster Camo (7.9 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here.

### Monster White (7.9 / 10)

This did not taste bad so I am putting it up here. Update: I had it after a few months and it doesn't hit the same?

### Nos (7.5 / 10)

Rating only

### Celsius Kiwi (7.5 / 10)

Definitely better than Orange, but a bit below Monster White

### Celsius Orange (7.25 / 10)

Orange

It's okay on its own. As soon as you eat something even a tad sweet, the flavour isn't as good as it could be

### Reign Storm Peach Nectarine (7 / 10)

Although it has a pleasant taste, it is missing a _kick_ found in drinks such as Monster White.

### Reign Energy Reignbow Sherbet (7 / 10)

This definitely is not on par with Monster White. It doesn't taste as good as I thought it did, so it's not worth a repurchase. However, if someone offered me to drink it, I would accept. I'll try to drink my last can chilled to figure out if the subpar taste was just because the drink was at room temperature.

### C4 Grape (6.7 / 10)

### C4 Hawaiian Punch  (6.7 / 10)

Tastes like a partial freezy that isn't frozen. So basically freezy juice lol.

### Celsius Cosmic Vibe (6.6 / 10)

Not disgusting, but only better than the unmemorable Ultra Paradise.

### Celsius Sunset Vibe (6.6 / 10)

I really believe this is the same as cosmic. My mouth is also quite dry from drinking it.

### Monster Energy Ultra Fantasy Ruby Red (6.6 / 10)

Only a bit better than Paradise, but not that good overall. After the next test (C4 hawaiian punch), I might buy some good drinks.

### Monster Energy Ultra Paradise (6.5 / 10)

Dawg what even is this. Give me my Monster White.

### Punch Monster Pacific Punch (6.5 / 10)

Make sure to drink when chilled. Tastes like Kool-Aid. I prefer Celsius Orange over this. I don't mind the calories as the sugar content is only 18% of daily value. But then again, I'm sensitive to sugar, so maybe I do mind.

### Punch Monster Mango Loco (4.5 / 10)

Tastes like Mango concentrate juice.

### Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams (4 / 10)

Monster White is better. The flavour is a hint of strawberry and then some concoction. It's not that enjoyable to drink and I'd even go further to say I'm having trouble drinking it! It doesn't taste as bad as White Pineapple.

### Monster Energy Reserve White Pineapple (3 / 10)

This is also not on par with Monster White. Although I like the Monster White flavour, the pineapple flavour ruins the drink. Pineapple juice is good enough to be honest. I put this under the Reignbow Sherbet just because the Reignbow Sherbet is fruity.

### Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle (2 / 10)

I will admit that I am a prejudice person when it comes to goods and services, however I am open minded because without having an open-mind, you can never push your own definition of perfection. I was biased against the Reign Energy Orange Dreamsicle because why would I want to taste Orange when I have orange juice?
I said why not because what if it would be better than Orange juice. I was wrong, it smells and tastes like medicine. Never buying again.

### Rockstar Energy Original (2 / 10)

I don't know what I was smoking when I decided to even review this. Disgusting.

### Reign Energy Cherry Limeade (1 / 10)

Disgusting. And by disgusting I mean not my cup of tea.
