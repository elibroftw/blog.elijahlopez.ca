summary: "Using income cutoffs for welfare benefits allows wealthy individuals with low income to benefit. I recommended using a 'CPI-poor' basket which utilizes the definition of poverty for better-targeted benefits."

I definitely do not like spending my time online reading literal garbage that is published on the internet. This article is about how policy makers are stupid.

Who did this? Brian Mulroney. It is estimated 83% of Canadians today have a favourable outcome of this prime minister who was so unpopular the conservative party got decimated in the next election.One of the worst policies of Mulroney was cutting social housing, which has lead to municipalities unable to handle the homeless crisis are thus seeking to use Section 31 of the CCRF in order to evict them when there are no shelters available. My conclusion from this happening is that housing is a federal government responsibility as long as they are not giving municipalities a fair deal of money without strings attached.

What are we talking about? GST Rebate. In economics, a sales tax is deemed regressive because as wealth increases, the percent expenditure on sales tax goes down. Thus poor people disproportionately affected. To counteract the regressiveness of a sales tax, a policy maker may choose to rebate some of the total revenue collected to those deemed poor. Now here in Canada, we use income cutoffs instead of wealth cutoffs. You could be a billionaire in Canada, but as long as your income is below a certain threshold, you are eligible for a lot of welfare benefits. But I'm just a 22 year old with two degrees, so maybe I'm not smarter than the government.

How does it relate to CPI? The GST Rebate has an income cutoff that is tied to CPI. The problem is that CPI reflects the **median/average** household basket of goods and services and not poor people. There is not such thing as a CPI-poor..

TODO: show how unskilled / lowskilled real wages have remained flat for decades.

ALSO: PEOPLE DO NOT DO ENOUGH READING, WE READ ONE HEADLINE AND FORM AN OPINION. MOST PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT ON IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE.

### Proposal for CPI-poor Basket

First we need to quantify what it means to be poor. At what point should you no longer get welfare (tapered off)?
