- Lots of content for this class.
- Focus on IFRS which has been GAAP since 2011 for Canadian publicly traded companies

## Chapter 13

- Financial liabilities vs other
- Current liabilities
- Identify and account for employee-related liabilities
- Decommissioning and restoration obligations

IFRS Related

- IAS 37 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
- IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment
- IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

### What is a Liability

#### IFRS

- Present obligation to transfer resource due to a past event

#### ASPE

- Duty to responsibility to others
- Little to no discretion to avoid the obligation
- Relates to a transaction

Obligations are legal or constructive and can be enforced. A constructive obligation is an expectation to do something but isn't written.

An example is how Best-Buy allows 60 -day returns even though the law is 30 days and Best Buy does not state they can do 60 days.

### Financial vs. Non-financial Liabilities

Financial Liability

- Deliver financial assets
- Exchange financial assets under unfavorable conditions

Non-Financial Liability

- Payable with non-financial resources (i.e. goods and services)
- **Income taxes payable** is considered a non-financial liability

### Measurement

SFP - Statement of financial position

Measurement    | Financial Liabilities  | Non-financial Liabilities
--------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------
At acquisition     | Fair Value         | IFRS: at best estimate at the date of SFP to settle president obligation, ASPE: no standard
After acquisition | Amortized cost (short-term liabilities at maturity value) | SEE ABOVE
Examples | Accounts payable, Notes payable, Current portion of long-term debt, Dividends payable, Rents/royalties payable, Customer advances and deposits, Taxes payable, employee- related liabilities, | Provisions related to assurance warranty, future dismantling and retirement of assets, unearned revenue, â€¦

### Current Liability Examples

- Bank Indebtedness (line of credit, revolving / flexible loan facility)
- Accounts payable (i.e., trade accounts payable)
  - Credit term of 2/10 n30 means 2% off in 10 days net of 30 days
  - Ordinary business activities
- Notes payable
  - Written promise to pay
  - Could be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing (in which case, we borrow at the present value of the note)
  - $100,000 four-month, 12% note on March 1st. Statements made on June and December.
    - on June 30th, credit interest expense amount to interest payable
  - non-interest bearing $100,000 four-month, 12% discount rate, present value of $96,154, on March 1st.
  - 96,154 = (100,000 / (1 + 12% * 4 / 12))
  - On March 1st, borrow the present value
  - On June 30th, credit interest expense amount to **notes payable**
- Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt
  - Classified as current liabilities unless the payment is with non-current assets
  - Due on demand loans
- Short-Term Debt Expected to be Refinanced
  - For both standards, use **under an existing agreement**
  - IFRS: If refinanced to >=12 months (at date on the statements), reclassify as long-term debt
  - ASPE: If the debt will be refinanced to >=12 months by the time the financial statements are issued, reclassify as long-term debt
  - Financial statements date: when statements are prepared or given
  - Reporting date: the date the financial statements are reporting on
- Cash Dividends Payable
- Preferred Dividends in Arrears
- Rents and Royalties Payable
- Taxes payable: sales tax, goods and services tax, income tax
- Employee-Related Liabilities

### Taxes Payable

- Sales tax is not a value-added tax. An example is provincial sales tax (PST) that is a separate sales tax
- Goods and Services Tax (GST). If companies charge customers, they can deduct input tax credit
- Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Same as GST.

Value-added Tax Example

```txt
Accounts receivables 3,390
  Sales revenue                     3,000
  HST payable                          390
```

Paid supplies $2,000 for the merchandise. Input tax credit = $260.

Hence, net HST payable = 390 - 260 = 130.

HST is refundable. Carousel scheme where Canada issues refunds when the first companies did not remit the tax.

#### Income Tax

- Suppose $21,000 has been estimated and no installments were made

```txt
Current tax expense       21,000
  Income tax payable            21,000
```

- Suppose $20,000 tax instalment was made at year end

```txt
Income tax payable        20,000
  Cash                                20,000
```

- Suppose $23,000 tax instalment

```txt
Income tax payable       21,000
Income tax receivable     2,000
  Cash                                            23,000
```

If tax instalment payments are made every 3 months, we need a year end adjusting entry.

- Case underpaid tax: Either a debit to current tax expense and a credit to income tax payable OR
- Case overpaid tax: Debit to income tax receivable and credit to current tax expense

#### More Current Liabilities

- Cash dividend payable
  - Corporation declared a dividend
  - Stock/shre dividends are not a liability
- Rents and Royalties payable
  - from contractual agreement
- Customer advance and deposits
  - returnable cash deposits or customer advance

### Employee-Related Liabilities

- Payroll deductions
  - Employee income tax
  - Canadian Pension Plan (CPP)
  - Employment Insurance (EI) premiums
  - Union Dues (discretionary)
  - Required employer contributions
    - CPP
    - EI Premium equal 1.4 times employees' EI contribution

```accounting
# employee deduction
Salaries and wages expense                              6,000
  CPP contributions payable                                   500
  EI premiums payable                                            100
  Union dues payable                                                50
  Employee income tax deductions payable        1,500
  Cash 3,                                                                 850
```

```accounting
# employer required
Payroll tax expense     640
  CPP contributions payable         500
  EI premiums payable         140
```

### Short-Term Compensated Absences

- statutory holidays; vacations
- Either **accumulated rights** or **non-accumulating compensated absences** (e.g. paternity leave)

### Profit-Sharing and Bonus Agreements

- regular rates of pay, productivity, or company profits
- obligations are current liabilities

### Decommissioning and Restoration Obligations

- Construction and operation of long-lived assets sometimes create obligations associated with the eventual retirement
- Asset retirement obligation (ARO) or site restoration obligation
- Recognized in the period incurred
- IFRS
  - constructive (like what is expected by the public) and legal
  - capitalized costs include acquisition only
  - production is inventory or product costs
- ASPE: legal obligations
  - capitalized costs might include all obligations but the production is as they occur
- ARO is a future cost, so capitalize the present value of the cost over the asset's useful life
  - Supposed $600,000 ARO cost and a 8% discount rate in five years. Therefore 600,000 / 1.08 ** 5.
- Incremental ARO costs:
  - IFRS: inventory or production costs
  - ASPE: capitalized
  - Since ARO is a present value, charge Interest Expense under IFRS and Accretion Expense under ASPE
  - Suppose 20% of ARO is because of production-related.
    - Use 80% for the journal entry
    - For IFRS add the ARO production cost to overhead costs and for ASPE debit the drilling platform
  - Straight-line depreciation on the asset over 5 years
    - for IFRS, we know the amount beforehand
    - for ASPE, depends on the incremental capitalized costs
  - Accrue the interest

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Interest expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
# Under ASPE
Accretion expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
```

Suppose that the ARO increased by $88,203 (present value based on the future ARO cost due to the production)

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Inventory     88,203
  ARO             88,203
# Under ASPE
Drilling Platform     88,203
  ARO                              88,203
```

Under IFRS COGS increases whereas under ASPE Depreciation expense will increase subsequent years.

Suppose upon dismantling, there is a higher cash payment that the ARO.

```accounting
across                                      600,000
Loss on Settlement of ARO        10,000
    Cash                                                         610,000
```

### Production Guarantees

Warranty is a promise to correct problems. Expense approach is still used for assurance-type warranties and revenue-approach is for service type warranties.

- Assurance-type warranty: built into the price
- Service-type warranty: separate performance obligation

- expense-approach: expense as occurred but recognize more if total cost > already-recognized expense
  - if there is an estimated warranty cost that was not incurred, expense the remaining estimate as warranty expense as at year-end and into warranty liability
  - deduct expenses related to warranty from the warranty liability account first before recognizing expensing the warranty expense account on income statement
- revenue-approach: recognize unearned revenue, expense as occurred, recognize revenue as performance obligation is satisfied
  - if future warranty cost exceeds unearned revenue, recognize a loss and a liability immediately. (onerous contract)

```accounting
# During the year 2023. Assume 30,000 is the estimated warranty cost.
Accounts receivable 1,000,000
  Revenue 1,000,000
Warranty expense 10,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 10,000
# Adjusting Entries on Dec. 31, 2023:
Warranty expense 20,000
  Warranty liability 20,000
```

```accounting
# As actual warranty costs incur in 2024
Warranty expense 25,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 25,000
# At year end, we need to adjust the liability account (no longer have liabilities)
# credit warranty expense to liability account
Warranty liability 20,000
  Warranty expense 20,000
```

### Loyalty Programs

- Purchase are partially loyalty points which  is unearned revenue for IFRS 15, optional under ASPE
- $100,000 products purchased, 10,000 points earned, 45% gross profit, 9,500 points to be redeemed
- One point worth $1 distributed for every $10

- Loyalty Points Unearned Revenue = $9,500
- Proportion of goods/services =  $100,000  \* (100,000 + $9,500) = $91,324
- Proportion of loyaty points = 100,000 - 91,324 = 8,676

```accounting
Cash                100,000
Sales revenue               91,324
Unearned revenue        8,676
```

```accounting
COGS      55,000
  Inventory         55,000
```

- Question: when do loyalty points hurt the store?

### Contingency

- IFRS:
  - contingent liability: in notes and not recognized
  - **more likely than not** is a provision: this is recognized and is a liability and a loss
  - do not disclose or recognize contingent gains
  - not a provision
- ASPE: likely
  - recognize as loss

### Commitments

- financial guarantee contract.

one party (the guarantor) contracts to reimburse a second party for a loss incurred if a third party (the debtor) does not make required payments when due

- ASPE: Follows the loss contingency standards
- IFRS: Fair Value, MAX(loss allowance, initial). Consider time value of money.

### Financial Statement Analysis

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- ACID test ratio = (cash + marketable securities + net receivables) / current liabilities
- Days payable outstanding = Average trade accounts payable / average daily cost of goods sold or average daily cost of total operating expenses

## Chapter 14

### Long-Term Debt

- Not payable within a year

### Bonds

- Why issue bonds? Capital required is too large for a single lender
- Purchased in small denominations
- Bond indenture (contract)
  - Coupon rate
  - Coupon payment dates
  - Face (par) value
  - [SEC example](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/)
- Issuing company sells bonds to investment banks which markets and sells to investors
- Prospectus filing and subject to securities regulation
  - Do non-publicly traded companies also need to do this
- Private sale does not require filing
- Who pays for rating?

### Common Types of Long-Term Debts

- Registered Bonds
  - Issues in the owner's name
- Bearer Bonds
  - Whoever bears the bonds is owed the money
- Secured debt
  - Mortgage bond or notes
  - Collateral trust bonds
- Income bons
Revenue bonds
- Deep discount bonds or notes
- Commodity-backed debt
- Callable bonds and notes
- Convertible debt

### Defeasance

- When company is not allowed to pay back debt before maturity date,
  - Legal: Give money to a trust to do it for you
  - Creditor agrees accept payment from trust (is this a must?)
  - Creditor gives up its claim to the company
- In-substance defeasance
  - Company does not inform creditor
  - no derecognition


### Bonds Issued at Discount or Premium

- IFRS: effective interest rate amortization
- ASPE: effective interest rate amortization or straight line

```accounting
Cash $800,000 Dr.
  Bonds Payable $800,000 Cr.

# Jul 1, 2023
Interest expense $40,000 Dr.
  Cash  $40,000 Cr.

# Dec 31
Interest Expense $40,000 Dr.
  Interest Payable $40,000 Cr.
```

```accounting
Interest expense = beginning carrying amount * effective market yield
                               = 88,700 * 12% = $10,644

Dr. Interest expense                               10,644
      Cr. Cash (coupon payment)                          10,000          (=100,000*10%)
      Cr. Bonds payable                                                644
```

### Bonds Issued Between Interest Dates

```accounting
# in this example 10% coupon, semi-annually, 12% yield, $100,000 par value
Dr. Cash                                                    96,750
       Cr. Bonds payable                                     95,083
       Cr. Interest expense (or payable)             1,667     (= 5,000 x 2/6 )
```

### Zero-interest Bearing Marketable Securities

- marketable meaning money that is given in the future is sold at the present value
- Company issued a bond with face value of 10,000 but the cash proceeds was 7,721.80.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?7721.80=\frac{10,000}{(1+r)^3}" alt="7721.80 = 10,000 / (1 + r)^3">

### Non-Marketable Instruments with noon-market rates

- Government grant of 100,000 with 10% discount rate?

```accounting
Cash        100,000
  Notes payable   62,092
  Buildings            37,908
```

### Notes Issued for non-cash proceeds (Property, Goods, or Services)

- if marketable security, use the fair value
- otherwise,
  - could discount with cashflow
  - fair value of assets received

### Fair Value Option

- Every period update to fair value
- IFRS: fair value only if it results in more relevant information
- Put unrealized gains in OCI which wil be wiped when debt is paid off
  - Example: Higher credit risk means that the market value of debt is lower (higher return = higher risk)
- ASPE: allows fair value option and no OCI so recognize in net income

### Extinguishment of Debt

- When debt is extinguished, it is derecognized
- Carrying value = maturity value; no gain or loss
- Repayment before maturity date
  - Prior to maturity: reacquisition price
  - Carrying amount = maturity value +- unamortized discount or premium and issuance costs
  - if carrying amount > reacquisition price: gain
  - if reacquisition price > carrying amount: loss

To calculate unamortization amount:

- straight-line method:
  - initial gain/loss divided by the number of years multiplied by number of year remaining on the bond
  - so if buying back a bond at 101 sold at a loss of 24,000 (97 of 800,000) 8 years later with a maturity of 20: `24,000 / 20 * 12 = 14,400`
  - reacquisition price - face value + unamortized amount gain (subtract the loss) = loss/gain
  - 808,000 - (800,000 - 14,400) = 22,400

### Exchange of Debt Instruments

- Refund
- substantially Different terms
- debt < carrying amount
- continuation of debt, with modified terms

1. Transfer non-cash assets
    - recognize a gain/loss on disposal of the non-cash asset
    - gain/loss on debt settlement needs to be recognized
    - creditor may be able to force a transfer (loan foreclosure)
2. Share transfer
3. Issue debt to another creditor, use proceeds to repay existing debt (refinancing)

A building with fair value of $16MM is transferred to settle a $20MM loan.

```accounting
# Creditor
Buildings $16M Dr.
Loss on loan $4M Dr.
  Notes receivable $20M Cr.
```

The building had a book value of $21M

```accounting
# Debtor
Building Depreciation             $5 Dr.
Notes Payable                     $20M Dr.
Loss on Building transfer       $5M Dr.
Buildings                                   $26M Cr.
Gain on Debt Restructuring      $4M Cr.
```

Share transfer

320,000 shares worth $16M is transferred. Creditor is treating it as FV-NI.

```accounting
# Creditor
FV-NI       $16M
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   $4MM  [Allowance for Expected Credit Losses]
  Notes Receivable                       $20M
```

```accounting
# debtor
Notes Payable        $20M Dr.
  Common Shares                   $16M Cr.
  Gain on Debt Restructuring    $4M Cr.
```

### Debt Term Modifications

- Stated interest
- Maturity date
- Face amount
- Reduction or deferral of accrued interest
- Change in currency

For it to be substantial, either the present value changes by at least 10% or the creditor changes.

```txt
On December 31, 2023, Manitoba National Bank enters into a debt restructuring agreement with Resorts Corp., which is experiencing financial difficulties. The current carrying amount of the loan is $10.5 million (the bond was issued at par). The modifications are as follows:
1. Reduce the current obligation from $10.5 million to $9 million.
2. Extend maturity date from Dec 31, 2023 to Dec 31, 2027.
3. Reduce interest rate (annual payment) from 12% to 8% (The current market rate is 9%).

Old terms have a PV of 10,500,000 (because already at maturity).
Use original effective interest to calculate PV of new terms which is 7,906,572.
The difference is ~ 33% so treat it as a settlement.

Notes payable 10,500,000 Dr.
  Notes payable                       8,708,425 Cr.   (market value based on yield and interest rate)
  Gain on Restructuring Debt  1,791,575 Cr.
```

Non-substantial,

- ASPE: Keep carrying amount the same, using the new maturity value and interest rate, solve for EIR, and calculate the new interest expense.
- IFRS: Remeasure carrying amount to the PV using market rate for the new obligations

### Off-Balance Sheet Financing

- Harder to do these days
- Non-consolidated entities
- Special purpose entity or variable interest entity
  - buy assets, take risk, isolate from other company
- operating leases (ASPE only)

### Debt Financial Statement Analysis

- Debt to Asset ratio = Total debt / Total assets
- Times interest earned = Income before taxes nad interest expense / interest expense
