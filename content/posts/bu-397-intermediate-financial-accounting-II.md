- Lots of content for this class.
- Focus on IFRS which has been GAAP since 2011 for Canadian publicly traded companies

## Chapter 13

- Financial liabilities vs other
- Current liabilities
- Identify and account for employee-related liabilities
- Decommissioning and restoration obligations

IFRS Related

- IAS 37 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
- IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment
- IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

### What is a Liability

#### IFRS

- Present obligation to transfer resource due to a past event

#### ASPE

- Duty to responsibility to others
- Little to no discretion to avoid the obligation
- Relates to a transaction

Obligations are legal or constructive and can be enforced. A constructive obligation is an expectation to do something but isn't written.

An example is how Best-Buy allows 60 -day returns even though the law is 30 days and Best Buy does not state they can do 60 days.

### Financial vs. Non-financial Liabilities

Financial Liability

- Deliver financial assets
- Exchange financial assets under unfavorable conditions

Non-Financial Liability

- Payable with non-financial resources (i.e. goods and services)
- **Income taxes payable** is considered a non-financial liability

### Measurement

SFP - Statement of financial position

Measurement    | Financial Liabilities  | Non-financial Liabilities
--------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------
At acquisition     | Fair Value         | IFRS: at best estimate at the date of SFP to settle president obligation, ASPE: no standard
After acquisition | Amortized cost (short-term liabilities at maturity value) | SEE ABOVE
Examples | Accounts payable, Notes payable, Current portion of long-term debt, Dividends payable, Rents/royalties payable, Customer advances and deposits, Taxes payable, employee- related liabilities, | Provisions related to assurance warranty, future dismantling and retirement of assets, unearned revenue, â€¦

### Current Liability Examples

- Bank Indebtedness (line of credit, revolving / flexible loan facility)
- Accounts payable (i.e., trade accounts payable)
  - Credit term of 2/10 n30 means 2% off in 10 days net of 30 days
  - Ordinary business activities
- Notes payable
  - Written promise to pay
  - Could be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing (in which case, we borrow at the present value of the note)
  - $100,000 four-month, 12% note on March 1st. Statements made on June and December.
    - on June 30th, credit interest expense amount to interest payable
  - non-interest bearing $100,000 four-month, 12% discount rate, present value of $96,154, on March 1st.
  - 96,154 = (100,000 / (1 + 12% * 4 / 12))
  - On March 1st, borrow the present value
  - On June 30th, credit interest expense amount to **notes payable**
- Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt
  - Classified as current liabilities unless the payment is with non-current assets
  - Due on demand loans
- Short-Term Debt Expected to be Refinanced
  - For both standards, use **under an existing agreement**
  - IFRS: If refinanced to >=12 months (at date on the statements), reclassify as long-term debt
  - ASPE: If the debt will be refinanced to >=12 months by the time the financial statements are issued, reclassify as long-term debt
  - Financial statements date: when statements are prepared or given
  - Reporting date: the date the financial statements are reporting on
- Cash Dividends Payable
- Preferred Dividends in Arrears
- Rents and Royalties Payable
- Taxes payable: sales tax, goods and services tax, income tax
- Employee-Related Liabilities

### Taxes Payable

- Sales tax is not a value-added tax. An example is provincial sales tax (PST) that is a separate sales tax
- Goods and Services Tax (GST). If companies charge customers, they can deduct input tax credit
- Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Same as GST.

Value-added Tax Example

```txt
Accounts receivables          3,390
  Sales revenue                      3,000
  HST payable                          390
```

Paid supplies $2,000 for the merchandise. Input tax credit = $260.

Hence, net HST payable = 390 - 260 = 130.

HST is refundable. Carousel scheme where Canada issues refunds when the first companies did not remit the tax.

#### Income Tax

- Suppose $21,000 has been estimated and no installments were made

```txt
Current tax expense       21,000
  Income tax payable            21,000
```

- Suppose $20,000 tax instalment was made at year end

```txt
Income tax payable        20,000
  Cash                                20,000
```

- Suppose $23,000 tax instalment

```txt
Income tax payable       21,000
Income tax receivable     2,000
  Cash                                            23,000
```

If tax instalment payments are made every 3 months, we need a year end adjusting entry.

- Case underpaid tax: Either a debit to current tax expense and a credit to income tax payable OR
- Case overpaid tax: Debit to income tax receivable and credit to current tax expense

#### More Current Liabilities

- Cash dividend payable
  - Corporation declared a dividend
  - Stock/shre dividends are not a liability
- Rents and Royalties payable
  - from contractual agreement
- Customer advance and deposits
  - returnable cash deposits or customer advance

### Employee-Related Liabilities

- Payroll deductions
  - Employee income tax
  - Canadian Pension Plan (CPP)
  - Employment Insurance (EI) premiums
  - Union Dues (discretionary)
  - Required employer contributions
    - CPP
    - EI Premium equal 1.4 times employees' EI contribution

```accounting
# employee deduction
Salaries and wages expense                6,000
  CPP contributions payable                       500
  EI premiums payable                             100
  Union dues payable                               50
  Employee income tax deductions payable        1,500
  Cash                                            850
```

```accounting
# employer required
Payroll tax expense               640
  CPP contributions payable             500
  EI premiums payable                   140
```

### Short-Term Compensated Absences

- statutory holidays; vacations
- Either **accumulated rights** or **non-accumulating compensated absences** (e.g. paternity leave)

### Profit-Sharing and Bonus Agreements

- regular rates of pay, productivity, or company profits
- obligations are current liabilities

### Decommissioning and Restoration Obligations

- Construction and operation of long-lived assets sometimes create obligations associated with the eventual retirement
- Asset retirement obligation (ARO) or site restoration obligation ; credit
- Recognized in the period incurred
- IFRS
  - constructive (like what is expected by the public) and legal
  - capitalized costs include acquisition only
  - production is inventory or product costs
- ASPE: legal obligations
  - capitalized costs might include all obligations but the production is as they occur
- ARO is a future cost, so capitalize the present value of the cost over the asset's useful life
  - Supposed $600,000 ARO cost and a 8% discount rate in five years. Therefore 600,000 / 1.08 ** 5.
- Incremental ARO costs:
  - IFRS: inventory or production costs
  - ASPE: capitalized
  - Since ARO is a present value, charge Interest Expense under IFRS and Accretion Expense under ASPE
  - Suppose 20% of ARO is because of production-related.
    - Use 80% for the journal entry
    - For IFRS add the ARO production cost to overhead costs and for ASPE debit the drilling platform
  - Straight-line depreciation on the asset over 5 years
    - for IFRS, we know the amount beforehand
    - for ASPE, depends on the incremental capitalized costs
  - Accrue the interest

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Interest expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
# Under ASPE
Accretion expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
```

Suppose that the ARO increased by $88,203 (present value based on the future ARO cost due to the production)

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Inventory     88,203
  ARO             88,203
# Under ASPE
Drilling Platform     88,203
  ARO                              88,203
```

Under IFRS COGS increases whereas under ASPE Depreciation expense will increase subsequent years.

Suppose upon dismantling, there is a higher cash payment that the ARO.

```accounting
ARO                           600,000
Loss on Settlement of ARO             10,000
    Cash                             610,000
```

### Production Guarantees

Warranty is a promise to correct problems. Expense approach is still used for assurance-type warranties and revenue-approach is for service type warranties.

- Assurance-type warranty: built into the price
- Service-type warranty: separate performance obligation

- expense-approach: expense as occurred but recognize more if total cost > already-recognized expense
  - if there is an estimated warranty cost that was not incurred, expense the remaining estimate as warranty expense as at year-end and into warranty liability
  - deduct expenses related to warranty from the warranty liability account first before recognizing expensing the warranty expense account on income statement
- revenue-approach: recognize unearned revenue, expense as occurred, recognize revenue as performance obligation is satisfied
  - if future warranty cost exceeds unearned revenue, recognize a loss and a liability immediately. (onerous contract)

```accounting
# During the year 2023. Assume 30,000 is the estimated warranty cost.
Accounts receivable 1,000,000
  Revenue 1,000,000
Warranty expense 10,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 10,000
# Adjusting Entries on Dec. 31, 2023:
Warranty expense 20,000
  Warranty liability 20,000
```

```accounting
# As actual warranty costs incur in 2024
Warranty expense 25,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 25,000
# At year end, we need to adjust the liability account (no longer have liabilities)
# credit warranty expense to liability account
Warranty liability 20,000
  Warranty expense 20,000
```

### Loyalty Programs

- Purchase are partially loyalty points which  is unearned revenue for IFRS 15, optional under ASPE
- $100,000 products purchased, 10,000 points earned, 45% gross profit, 9,500 points estimated to be redeemed
- One point worth $1 distributed for every $10

- Loyalty Points Unearned Revenue = $9,500
- Proportion of goods/services =  $100,000  \* (100,000 / (100,000 + 9,500)) = $91,324
- Proportion of loyaty points = 100,000 - 91,324 = 8,676

```accounting
Cash                100,000
Sales revenue               91,324
Unearned revenue        8,676
```

```accounting
COGS                 55,000
  Inventory                  55,000
```

- Question: when do loyalty points hurt the store?

For expense method, the premiums expense is based off the difference. So (Price - Cost) multiplied by the number of units (redemption and then expected - redemption).

### Contingency

- IFRS:
  - contingent liability: in notes and not recognized
  - **more likely than not** is a provision: this is recognized and is a liability and a loss
  - do not disclose or recognize contingent gains
  - not a provision
- ASPE: likely
  - recognize as loss

### Commitments

- financial guarantee contract.

one party (the guarantor) contracts to reimburse a second party for a loss incurred if a third party (the debtor) does not make required payments when due

- ASPE: Follows the loss contingency standards
- IFRS: Fair Value, MAX(loss allowance, initial). Consider time value of money.

### Financial Statement Analysis

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- ACID test ratio = (cash + marketable securities + net receivables) / current liabilities
- Days payable outstanding = Average trade accounts payable / average daily cost of goods sold or average daily cost of total operating expenses

## Chapter 14

### Long-Term Debt

- Not payable within a year

### Bonds

- Why issue bonds? Capital required is too large for a single lender
- Purchased in small denominations
- Bond indenture (contract)
  - Coupon rate
  - Coupon payment dates
  - Face (par) value
  - [SEC example](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/)
- Issuing company sells bonds to investment banks which markets and sells to investors
- Prospectus filing and subject to securities regulation
  - Do non-publicly traded companies also need to do this
- Private sale does not require filing
- Who pays for rating?

### Common Types of Long-Term Debts

- Registered Bonds
  - Issues in the owner's name
- Bearer Bonds
  - Whoever bears the bonds is owed the money
- Secured debt
  - Mortgage bond or notes
  - Collateral trust bonds
- Income bons
Revenue bonds
- Deep discount bonds or notes
- Commodity-backed debt
- Callable bonds and notes
- Convertible debt

### Defeasance

- When company is not allowed to pay back debt before maturity date,
  - Legal: Give money to a trust to do it for you
  - Creditor agrees accept payment from trust (is this a must?)
  - Creditor gives up its claim to the company
- In-substance defeasance
  - Company does not inform creditor
  - no derecognition

### Bonds Issued at Discount or Premium

To calculate the market price or proceeds, we need to sum the present value of the face value as well as present value of the ordinary annuity. Use a present value factor where periods is the years times the number of payments per year and the rate is the effective interest rate divided by the number of payments per year.

- IFRS: effective interest rate amortization
  - periods = coupons per year \* maturity in years
  - amt = coupon per period not per year
- ASPE: effective interest rate amortization or straight line

```accounting
# fair value transaction
Cash $800,000 Dr.
  Bonds Payable $800,000 Cr.

# Jul 1, 2023
Interest expense $40,000 Dr.
  Cash  $40,000 Cr.

# Dec 31
Interest Expense $40,000 Dr.
  Interest Payable $40,000 Cr.
```

```accounting
# discounted bond of $100,000, 10%C, y=12%
Cash                    $88,700
  Bonds Payables      $88,700
```

```accounting
# Interest expense = beginning carrying amount * effective market yield (divide by number of payments per year)
                               = 88,700 * 12% = $10,644

Dr. Interest expense                               10,644
      Cr. Cash (coupon payment)                          10,000          (=100,000*10%)
      Cr. Bonds payable                                                644
```

### Bonds Issued Between Interest Dates

```accounting
# in this example 10% coupon, semi-annually, 12% yield, $100,000 par value
Dr. Cash                                                    96,750
       Cr. Bonds payable                                     95,083
       Cr. Interest payable             1,667     (= 5,000 x 2/6 )
```

### Zero-Coupon Marketable Securities

- marketable meaning money that is given in the future is sold at the present value
- Company issued a bond with face value of 10,000 but the cash proceeds was 7,721.80.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?7721.80=\frac{10,000}{(1+r)^3}" alt="7721.80 = 10,000 / (1 + r)^3">

### Non-Marketable Instruments with non-market rates

- Government grant of 100,000 with 10% discount rate?

```accounting
Cash                    100,000
  Notes payable                 62,092
  Buildings                     37,908
```

### Notes Issued for non-cash proceeds (Property, Goods, or Services)

- if marketable security, use the fair value
- otherwise,
  - could discount with cashflow
  - fair value of assets received

### Fair Value Option

- Every period update to fair value
- IFRS: fair value only if it results in more relevant information
- Put unrealized gains in OCI which will be wiped when debt is paid off
  - Example: Higher credit risk means that the market value of debt is lower (higher return = higher risk)
- ASPE: allows fair value option and no OCI so recognize in net income

### Extinguishment of Debt

- When debt is extinguished, it is derecognized
- Carrying value = maturity value; no gain or loss
- Repayment before maturity date
  - Prior to maturity: reacquisition price
  - Carrying amount = maturity value +- unamortized discount or premium and issuance costs
  - if carrying amount > reacquisition price: gain
  - if reacquisition price > carrying amount: loss

To calculate unamortization amount:

- straight-line method:
  - initial gain/loss divided by the number of years multiplied by number of year remaining on the bond
  - so if buying back a bond at 101 sold at a loss of 24,000 (97 of 800,000) 8 years later with a maturity of 20: `24,000 / 20 * 12 = 14,400`
  - reacquisition price - face value + unamortized amount gain (subtract the loss) = loss/gain
  - 808,000 - (800,000 - 14,400) = 22,400

### Exchange of Debt Instruments

- Refund
- substantially Different terms
- debt < carrying amount
- continuation of debt, with modified terms

1. Transfer non-cash assets
    - recognize a gain/loss on disposal of the non-cash asset
    - gain/loss on debt settlement needs to be recognized
    - creditor may be able to force a transfer (loan foreclosure)
2. Share transfer
3. Issue debt to another creditor, use proceeds to repay existing debt (refinancing)

A building with fair value of $16MM is transferred to settle a $20MM loan.

```accounting
# Creditor
Buildings               16M
Loss on loan             4M
  Notes receivable            20M
```

The building had a book value of $21M

```accounting
# Debtor
Building Depreciation              5M
Notes Payable                     20M
Loss on Building transfer          5M
Buildings                                26M
Gain on Debt Restructuring                4M
```

Share transfer

320,000 shares worth $16M is transferred. Creditor is treating it as FV-NI.

```accounting
# Creditor
FV-NI       $16M
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   $4MM  [Allowance for Expected Credit Losses]
  Notes Receivable                       $20M
```

```accounting
# debtor
Notes Payable        $20M Dr.
  Common Shares                   $16M Cr.
  Gain on Debt Restructuring    $4M Cr.
```

### Debt Term Modifications

- Stated interest
- Maturity date
- Face amount
- Reduction or deferral of accrued interest
- Change in currency

For it to be substantial, either the present value changes by at least 10% or the creditor changes.

```txt
On December 31, 2023, Manitoba National Bank enters into a debt restructuring agreement with Resorts Corp., which is experiencing financial difficulties. The current carrying amount of the loan is $10.5 million (the bond was issued at par). The modifications are as follows:
1. Reduce the current obligation from $10.5 million to $9 million.
2. Extend maturity date from Dec 31, 2023 to Dec 31, 2027.
3. Reduce interest rate (annual payment) from 12% to 8% (The current market rate is 9%).

Old terms have a PV of 10,500,000 (because already at maturity).
Use original effective interest to calculate PV of new terms which is 7,906,572.
The difference is ~ 33% so treat it as a settlement.

Notes payable 10,500,000 Dr.
  Notes payable                       8,708,425 Cr.   (market value based on yield and interest rate)
  Gain on Restructuring Debt  1,791,575 Cr.
```

Non-substantial,

- ASPE: Keep carrying amount the same, using the new maturity value and interest rate, solve for EIR, and calculate the new interest expense.
- IFRS: Remeasure carrying amount to the PV using market rate for the new obligations

### Off-Balance Sheet Financing

- Harder to do these days
- Non-consolidated entities
- Special purpose entity or variable interest entity
  - buy assets, take risk, isolate from other company
- operating leases (ASPE only)

### Debt Financial Statement Analysis

- Debt to Asset ratio = Total debt / Total assets
- Times interest earned = Income before taxes nad interest expense / interest expense

## Chapter 15 Shareholders' Equity

### Basic Forms

- Proprietorship
  - Single owner
- Partnership
  - Multipler owners
- Corporation
  - >= 1 owner
  - Seperate legal entity
  - Taxed seperately, and personal tax is at dividends
  - Owners only risk investment

### Corporate Classification

- Public / Crown Corporation
  - Government units - no shares
  - Government Business Entreprises - issues shares (e.g. canada post)
- Private Sector
  - Not-for-profit
    - no shares, since no distributions of profits
  - for profit
    - shares issued
    - privately held
    - publicly traded

### Incorporation Process

- Submit articles of incorporation
  - Maximum shares
  - Addresses
  - Directors
  - Share classes

### Shares

- Groups or classes
- Each share is equal to another in the same class
- If no restrictions, there are basic or inherent rights
- CBCA also allows pre-emptive rights
- Basic or Inherent Rights
  - Share proportionally in profits and losses
  - Management (vote for directors)
  - Corporate assets upon liquidation
- Pre-emptive rights
  - allows shareholders to purchase new share issuances
  - protects against involuntary dilution

### Types of Shares

- Common
  - Ownership interest
  - Right to elect board of directors
  - Default share type
- In-Substance Common Shares
  - Similar to common shares BUT cannot be called common shares for account purposes
- Preferred Shares
  - Assurance of dividend before common shares
  - Priority over all other types of shares over earnings and assets upon dissolution
  - No voting rights
  - No share in profit higher than stated rate
  - Features at corporation's discretion:
    - Cumulative in dividend arrears
    - Convertible to common shares
    - Callable/Redeemable at specified dates and prices
    - Retractable - Can sell their shares back to company and mus tbe paid
    - Participating - share in profit distribution
  - CBCA does not allow shares issued with a par value
  - Expressed as a percentage of issue price
  - Shareholder investment cannot be withdrawn at shareholders' discretion unless all prior claims have been paid

### Legality of Dividend Distribution

1. No dividends unless the corporate capital is kept intact
    - Net assets should be sufficient for solvency purposes
    - CBCA Corporate Solvency Tests
      - After dividend, can the corporation pay its liabilities
      - After dividend, is the realizable value of assets less than total liabilities plus legal capital
        - Portion of company's equity protected by law
2. Dividends must be formally approved by the board of directors
3. Dividends must agree with stipulations in the contracts (debt)

### Issuance of Shares

- Initial Public Offering (IPO)
- Seasoned share issuance

```accounting
# 500 shares at $10
Cash                        $5,000 Dr.
  Common shares       $5,000 Cr.
# 100 preferred shares at $10 per share
Cash                      $1,000 Dr.
  Preferred Shares          $1,000 Cr.
```

### Shares Sold on a Subscription Basis

- Partial payment
- Share only issued until full price received
- Cash already debited
- 10 common shares, at $20, 50 people accept, 50% down, due in 6 months

```accounting
Share subscriptions receivable    $10,000
  Common shares subscribed                $10,000
# first instalment
Cash                              $5,000
  Share subscriptions receivable          $5,000
# final instalment
Cash                              $5,000
  Share subscriptions receivable          $5,000
# settlement
Common shares subscribed          $10,000
  Common shares                          $10,000
```

In case of default, possible actions are:

- refund paid amount

```accounting
Common shares subscribed $1,000
    Share subscription $500
    Accounts Payable $500
```

- treat paid amount as forfeited; transfer to contributed surplus
- issue fewer shares

### Shares issued with other securities

- for lum-sum sales
- relative fair value method
  - estimate fair values of each class of securities, then proportionally allocates the lump-sum to each instrument
- residual value method
  - allocate lump-sum to instruments that are easier to measure, then allocate rest to the other instruments

### Cost of Issuing Shares

- Capital-related (deduct from proceeds)
  - Underwriting
  - Accounting and legal fees
  - Printing
  - Taxes
- Operation-related (expenses)
  - management
  - maintaining records

### Reacquisition or Repurchases of Shares

- increase ROE
- provide shares for employee share compensation
- business acquisitions or mergers
- stop takeovers
- demand to affect share price
- leverage buy-out (LBO)
- manage regulatory capital requirements
- reacquired shares are either retired or held as treasury shares (inteded for re-issue)
- CBCA required shares to be cancelled and restored status to authorized but unissued
- treasury relatively uncommon in canada

if reacquisition cost < average issuance price

```accounting
Dr. Share capital $1,000
  Cr. Cash $800
  Cr. Contributed Surplus $200
```

if > average issuance price

```accounting
Dr. Share capital          $1,000  (= $10 x 100)
     Cr. Cash                                  $1,200 (= $12 x 100)

Debit $200 to contributed surplus and then to retained earnings
```

- Share account Book Value per share is the average issuing price

### Dividends

- Date of declaration (board passes resolution)
- Date of record (eligibility of shareholders)
  - business day before ex-dividend date
- Date of payment

- share of earnings
- liquidating dividends (when operations are exhausted, think mining, oil & gas, resource extraction)

### Cash Dividends

Cash dividend of 50 cents a share on 1.8MM shares on July 16 to all shareholders of record on June 24.

```accounting
# after declaration (note no retained earnings account)
# JE not necessary for preferred share dividends since they are always payable for the year
Dividends Declared (- Equity) $900,000
  Dividends Payable (+ Liability)       $900,000
# nothing on entry date
# payment date
Dividends Payable           $900,000
  Cash                                  $900,000
```

### Property (in-kind) Dividends

- Generally measured at fair value of assets given up
- Non-reciprocal transfer of non-monetary assets between an entity and its owners
- Merchandise, real estate, investments

### Stock Dividends

- 1,000 common shares
- $50,000 retained earnings
- $130 per share fair value
- All shareholders received stock dividends

```accounting
# 1000 * 0.1 * 130 = $13,000
# on declaration
Retained earnings               Dr. 13,000
  Stock Dividends Distributable             Cr. 13,000
# on distribution
Stock Dividends Distributable   Dr. 13,000
  Common Shares                             Cr. 13,000
```

### Liquidating Dividends

- paid out of contributed surplus
- excess of accumulated income considered a return of shareholders' investment
- Example 1.2M dividend with $900,000 considered a return of income

```accounting
Retained Earnings   900,000
Contributed Surplus  300,000
  Dividends Payable         1,200,000
```

### Non-cumulative and Non-participating preferred shares

- Question: is it cheaper to issue bonds or preferred shares
  - Probably bonds since the interest payments are guaranteed and fixed
  - So why would you ever issue a preferred shares if it is more expensive? just because it can be stopped temporarily?
- $50,000 to be distributed as cash dividends
- $400,000 book value
- 1,000 $6 preferred shares out standing with book value of $100,000
  - preferred dividend is 6% of book value

```accounting
# non-cumulative preferred shares and non-participating
Total dividends declared $50,000
Less Preferred shares paid first $6,000
Balance available to common shareholders $44,000
# cumulative and non-participating, last 2 years are also due
total dividend declared $50,000
Less: dividends in arrears $12,000
Preferred shares current  $6,000
To common shares:   $32,000
# cumulative and participating
# need to treat the preferred share dividend as if it is part of the proportion so that the proportion of dividends is fair for common
Total dividends declared $50,000
Less; preferred in arrears: 12,000
-----------------------------
Less: preferred 6% 6,000
Less: common 6% 24,000
To preferred (20% of 8,000):  1,600
To common (80% of 8,000): 6,400
```

In case 1, the participation is capped

### Stock Splits vs Stock Dividends

- Lower stock market price = easier to acquire
- If stock dividends are large enough, it's basically a stock split (SEC)
- large stock dividend is more than 20% and is not mentioned about in ASPE and IFRS
- 2 for 1 stock split: 2 shares for every 1 currently issued

### Components of Shareholders' Equity

1. Share capital (provided by shareholders)
2. Contributed Surplus (provided by shareholders)
3. Retained Earnings (earned)
4. Accumulated OCI (earned)

- IFRS: detailed changes in shareholders' equity
- ASPE: only retained earnings, contributed capital in notes

### Capital Disclosure

- Amount of authorized, issued and fully paid shares
- Rights, preferences, any restrictions
- Reconciliation between opening and closing balances
- Restrictions on shares
- IFRS:
- Objectives, policies, processes for managing capital
- Summary quantitative date about what the company manages as capital, and any changes

### Equity Financial Statement Analysis

- ROE = (Net Income - Preferred dividends) / (average common common shareholders' equity)
- Dividend payout (Cash dividends) / (net income - preferred dividends)
- PE ratio = (market price per share) / (earnings per share)
- Book value per share = Common shareholders' equity / number of common shares outstanding

## Chapter 16 Complex Financial Instruments

- effect of transferring the one or more financial risks inherent in the underlying primary instrument
- PV of a forward contract is 0; so no initial investment
- main purpose is for risk management or hedging. Other purposes is speculation and arbitraging.
- Risks: market risk, credit risk (counterparty), and liqduity risk (companies paying off debt obligations)
- Measure at FV-NI
  - remeasure on SFP dates
- Purchase commitments are not derivatives unless
  - ASPE: exchange traded futures

A stock warrant gives the holder the right to purchase a company's stock at a specific price and at a specific date. A stock warrant is issued directly by the company concerned; when an investor exercises a stock warrant, the shares that fulfill the obligation are not received from another investor but directly from the company.

Company A has 5,000 shares of Company B and bought 5,000 put options at $2/put option. Strike price is $100 per share (current value).

- Purpose: Company B is willing to lose a maximum of $2 per share and wants to limit the downside to this amount
- Investments (FV-NI). Declines would be posted to net income
- No the accounting is no transparent, because the NI and OCI are different when underlying goes down
G

### Futures

- Exchange-traded
- Standardized amounts and dates
- Settled through clearing houses
- Requires collateral (margin)
- Settled daily
- G/L Recognized against income

Short $1,000 grain contract settling in 30 days. Initial $100 margin.

```accounting
Derivatives - Deposit   100
  Cash                            100
```

The value of grain increases, so our position decreases (futures contract moved against the company).

```accounting
Gain or Loss                                  50
  Derivatives - Financial Assets/Liabilities      50
```

Suppose there is a margin call for $50

```accounting
Derivatives - Deposit         50
  Cash                            50
```

Settled on net basis

```accounting
# clearing house already settled this to the counterparty
Cash                      100
Derivatives                50
  Derivatives - Deposit        150
```

### Derivatives Involving the Entity's Own Shares

- IFRS: Fixed-for-fixed equity transaction (gross settlement)
- ASPE: silent, general principles would say contra equity
- When purchasing an options, debit the contributed surplus first

```accounting
Contributed surplus           200
  Cash                              200
```

Company A agrees to purchase $50,000 US for $65,000 CAD in 30 days. There is a fair value of $500 on the issue date.
On settlement the ratio is $1.25 CDN = $1 US (versus 1.3 agreement)

```accounting
Derivatives       500
  Gain or Loss        500
# gross basis settlement
Cash               62,500
Gain or Loss        3,000
  Cash                             65,000
  Derivatives                         500
# net basis settlement
G/L             3,000
  Cash                      2,500
  Derivatives               500
```

### Hybrid/Compound Investments

- preferred shares
- convertible debt
- redeemable shares
- Debt classification requires meeting financial liabilities definition
  - contractual obligation
  - deliver cash or financial asset to another party
  - potentially unfavourable exchange of financial assets
- Equity:
  - residual interest after deducting liabilities
- Offsetting?
  - Only if there is a legal right and intended to settle
- Measurement
  - Residual value approach (incremental). IFRS. Debt first.
  - Relative fair value (proportional). Equity can be valued as zero or residual method. Easier first
  - debt measured at Amortized cost

### Convertible Debt

- holder has option to exchange for common shares
- raise capital without giving up ownership
- lower interest rate, since investors can ride on share value increase
- B corp. offers 3-year, 6% annual coupon, convertible bonds par = $1000. Convertible to 250 shares trading at $3/share. Similar straight line bonds carry an interest rate of 9%. 1,000 bonds are issued at par.
  - To get the present value without derivative rights, use the same coupon payment, but different discount rate

## Chapter 18 Income Taxes

- IFRS: Deferred vs. ASPE: Future
- To calculate current taxes: add temporary and permanent differences back to accounting income and then multiply by the tax rate
  - Permanent differences: an accounting deduction not recognized by CRA
  - Temporary differences: accounting and tax recognition is different for certain assets and (liabilities)
- To calculate Deferred/Future Tax Expense (Benefit) create a table (CB, TB, DIFF, TAX DIFF):
  - Multiply each difference between the accounting book value and the tax base/value by the tax rate (sum of tax applicable/deductible in the future if tax rates differ) and sum the values to get the net deferred/future expense (benefit). Liabilities have negative book value for the purposes of this calculation.
  - If the value is positive, we debit _D/F Tax Expense_ against _D/F Tax Liability_, and if it is negative then we credit _D/F Tax Benefit_ against _D/F Tax Asset_
  - In the future, a the tax liability is reduced by crediting deferred tax benefit and a tax asset is reduced by debiting deferred tax expense

<details><summary>Other</summary>

- Some expenses are not tax deductible
- financial reporting: receivable, tax purposes: when cash comes in
- financial: percentage of completion, tax purposes: when contract is completed
- financial: warranty liability expense, tax purposes: not a cash expense so don't recognize
- financial: litigation liability, tax purposes: not a cash expense so don't recognize
- financial: unearned revenue for cash, tax purposes: cash came in so recognize
- financial: straight line depreciation, tax purposes: accelerated (CCA)
- financial: fines and penalties, tax purposes: non-commercial expenses are not tax-deductible

</details>

### Temporary Difference Approach - Deferred/Future Tax Expenses

- In ASPE, use FUTURE, under IFRS use DEFERRED
- If settlement results in higher tax payable, it's a deferred tax liability (increase taxes in the future)
- if the other way, deferred tax asset (reduce taxes in the future)
- tax base/basis of an asset
  - deductible for tax purposes after carrying amount is recovered

Example

30% tax rate

end of year | Carrying Value | Tax Base | Temporary Difference | Deferred Tax Balance

- carrying value 1000, 900, 800
- deducted: 0, 200, 400
- tax base 1000, 700, 500
- difference 0, 200, 300
- deferred: 0, 200 \* 30% = 60, 300 \* 30% = 90

### Tax Base / Tax Basis of Liability

- tax base = Carrying amount - future tax deductions
- when liability can be settled for its carrying amount without any tax consequences, tax base = carrying amount
- unearned revenue: settlement is via recognition so no tax effect

Example - Deferred Tax Liability

- Company A reported $130,000 revenue in 2023
- $100,000 was taxable revenue in 2023 (collected)
- 20,000 will be collected in 2024, and 10,000 in 2025
- 25% tax rate
- income tax payable is 10,000 in 2023, 11,000 in 2024

```accounting
2023
Current Income Tax Expense                  10,000
Deferred Income Tax Expense                   7,500

  Deferred Tax Liability (30,000 * 25%)                 7,500

2024
Deferred Income Tax Liability       5,000
  Deferred tax benefit                             5,000
# deferred tax benefit is because the expense already reduced retained earnings the year before and so an accounting benefit is being used here
Current income tax expense        11,000
  Income tax payable                             11,000
```

Example - Deferred Tax Asset

- 2 year assurance warranty expense
- estimated 500,000 expense
- actual costs were 300,000 in 2024, 200,000 in 2025
- income tax payable: 600,000 in 2023, 440,000 in 2024
- future tax rate is 25%
- warranty liability
  - 2023: 500,000 recognized vs. 0 actual &rarr; 25% * 500,000 = 125,000 asset
  - 2024: 200,000 recognized vs. 0 actual &rarr; 25% * 200,000 = 50,000 asset remaining
  - 2025: 0 recognized vs. 0 &rarr; 0

### CCA Recap

- Accelerate Investment Incentive (1.5x) applies only to net additions
- UCC<sub>end</sub> = UCC<sub>start</sub>- CCA RATE \* (UCC_0  + NET ADDITIONS \* 1.5 [only if net additions > 0])`

### Future Tax Rebates

- use income tax rates that are expected to apply when the tax liabilities are settled or tax assets are realized
- ASPE: tabled bills that the government can pass
- IFRS: announcements are actual enactment
- discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities is not permitted
- the deferred tax liability is calculated using the future expected tax rates for each future taxable amount
Example

### Tax Loss Carry-forward or Carry-back

- Can carry tax loss back up to 3 years
- Can carry forward for 20 years ahead
- Can be attractive merger candidates as income can be reduced
- We carry back the **loss** and not the **loss \* tax rate**
  - Suppose loss of 350,000 and that previous 3 years had total losses of 300,000
  - therefore, the carry back is calculated on the previous tax rates but is limited to 50,000

```accounting
Income tax receivable 82,500     (+A)
  Current tax benefit 82,500     (+SE)  Current benefit from loss carry-back
```

For a carry forward, suppose the tax loss that can be carried forward is 150,000 and the future rate is 20%.

```accounting
deferred tax asset        30,000
  deferred tax benefit            30,000
  # Deferred tax benefit from loss carry-forward
```

In a future year with taxable income, we use deferred tax expense

```accounting
taxable income = (200,000 - 150,000) = 50,000
taxable = 10,000
deferred = 30,000

Current Tax Expense         10,000
  Income Tax Payable                10,000

Deferred Tax Expense        30,000
  Deferred Tax Asset                30,000
```

### Separate Disclosure

- IFRS requires it
- ASPE: netted

### Valuation Allowance

- If unlikely to benefit from loss carryforward,
- ASPE: future tax asset is recognized with an offsetting variance allowance (contra)
- IFRS: not recognized at all

## Midterm Tips

- Apply knowledge to exercise questions
  - Exercises in this document, the quizzes, the assignment, group project

## Chapter 17 Earnings Per Share

- The main goal of financial accounting is decision-usefulness
- Perspective of common shareholder

Does EPS communicate maintainence capex? Yes, through depreciation expense. Does EPS communicate growth in CAPEX that was useless? Yes, through lower revenues and higher depreciation.

- Paper: current expected credit loss model amplifies stock market reactions to earnings surprises (actual EPS over consensus EPS by sell-side analysts). Amplification = over-reaction.
- Bank are motivated to beat or meet EP targets by under-provisioning:
  - Over-provision (over-expense) when economy is already bad (taking a big bath)
  - Under provision next year (to appear good out there)

If companies are motivated to meet or beat EPS via manipulation, EPS loses relevance and contradicts the accounting framework. Need to update standards or enforce (provincial in Canada, SEC in USA).

### Basic EPS

Actual earnings over the weighted average number of common shares outstanding

### Diluted EPS

Considering dilutions due to complex financial instruments at play.

### EPS IFRS vs ASPE

- ASPE does not need to report EPS calculations or disclosure
- Three lines for EPS from: continuing operations, discontinued operations, net income
- Need to show basic and diluted for both types

### Price Earnings Ratio

- Useful information by relating earnings to the price the shares are trading at
- Allows "easy comparison" with other companies
- Multiplier of per share market value
- If Among similar companies one has a higher P/E, it may be overpriced

### Simple vs Complex Capital Structure

- For simple ones without convertibles, just basic EPS
- For complex capital structures, securities that will potentially dilute the EPS, need to be included in the diluted EPS

### Income Available to Common Shareholders

- Deduct obligations to non-common shareholders such as current preferred dividends. Do not include arrears as they were included already

### Weighted Average Common Shares Example

Start of year: 200,000. July 1st: 225,000. Net income: 315,000.

`Basic EPS = 315000 / (200000 * 0.5 + 425000 * 0.5) = 1.008 = 1.01`

Restatement of average number of shares is required before a stock dividend or split event (so past results can be normalized).

### In-Class EPS Exercse

```accounting
Shares outstanding Jan 1: 150,000
2-for-1 stock split, Apr 1:     150,000
Shares issued, Jul 1:   20,000
Shares repurchased, Oct 1: -50,000
Shares issued:, Dec 31: 10,000
Ending Balance:           280,000

Income to common shareholders: 470,000

Basic EPS = $1.58
