- Lots of content for this class.
- Focus on IFRS which has been GAAP since 2011 for Canadian publicly traded companies

## Chapter 13

- Financial liabilities vs other
- Current liabilities
- Identify and account for employee-related liabilities
- Decommissioning and restoration obligations

IFRS Related

- IAS 37 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
- IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment
- IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

### What is a Liability

#### IFRS

- Present obligation to transfer resource due to a past event

#### ASPE

- Duty to responsibility to others
- Little to no discretion to avoid the obligation
- Relates to a transaction

Obligations are legal or constructive and can be enforced. A constructive obligation is an expectation to do something but isn't written.

An example is how Best-Buy allows 60 -day returns even though the law is 30 days and Best Buy does not state they can do 60 days.

### Financial vs. Non-financial Liabilities

Financial Liability

- Deliver financial assets
- Exchange financial assets under unfavorable conditions

Non-Financial Liability

- Payable with non-financial resources (i.e. goods and services)
- **Income taxes payable** is considered a non-financial liability

### Measurement

SFP - Statement of financial position

Measurement    | Financial Liabilities  | Non-financial Liabilities
--------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------
At acquisition     | Fair Value         | IFRS: at best estimate at the date of SFP to settle president obligation, ASPE: no standard
After acquisition | Amortized cost (short-term liabilities at maturity value) | SEE ABOVE
Examples | Accounts payable, Notes payable, Current portion of long-term debt, Dividends payable, Rents/royalties payable, Customer advances and deposits, Taxes payable, employee- related liabilities, | Provisions related to assurance warranty, future dismantling and retirement of assets, unearned revenue, â€¦

### Current Liability Examples

- Bank Indebtedness (line of credit, revolving / flexible loan facility)
- Accounts payable (i.e., trade accounts payable)
  - Credit term of 2/10 n30 means 2% off in 10 days net of 30 days
  - Ordinary business activities
- Notes payable
  - Written promise to pay
  - Could be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing (in which case, we borrow at the present value of the note)
  - $100,000 four-month, 12% note on March 1st. Statements made on June and December.
    - on June 30th, credit interest expense amount to interest payable
  - non-interest bearing $100,000 four-month, 12% discount rate, present value of $96,154, on March 1st.
  - 96,154 = (100,000 / (1 + 12% * 4 / 12))
  - On March 1st, borrow the present value
  - On June 30th, credit interest expense amount to **notes payable**
- Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt
  - Classified as current liabilities unless the payment is with non-current assets
  - Due on demand loans
- Short-Term Debt Expected to be Refinanced
  - For both standards, use **under an existing agreement**
  - IFRS: If refinanced to >=12 months (at date on the statements), reclassify as long-term debt
  - ASPE: If the debt will be refinanced to >=12 months by the time the financial statements are issued, reclassify as long-term debt
  - Financial statements date: when statements are prepared or given
  - Reporting date: the date the financial statements are reporting on
- Cash Dividends Payable
- Preferred Dividends in Arrears
- Rents and Royalties Payable
- Taxes payable: sales tax, goods and services tax, income tax
- Employee-Related Liabilities

### Taxes Payable

- Sales tax is not a value-added tax. An example is provincial sales tax (PST) that is a separate sales tax
- Goods and Services Tax (GST). If companies charge customers, they can deduct input tax credit
- Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Same as GST.

Value-added Tax Example

```txt
Accounts receivables 3,390
  Sales revenue                     3,000
  HST payable                          390
```

Paid supplies $2,000 for the merchandise. Input tax credit = $260.

Hence, net HST payable = 390 - 260 = 130.

HST is refundable. Carousel scheme where Canada issues refunds when the first companies did not remit the tax.

#### Income Tax

- Suppose $21,000 has been estimated and no installments were made

```txt
Current tax expense       21,000
  Income tax payable            21,000
```

- Suppose $20,000 tax instalment was made at year end

```txt
Income tax payable        20,000
  Cash                                20,000
```

- Suppose $23,000 tax instalment

```txt
Income tax payable       21,000
Income tax receivable     2,000
  Cash                                            23,000
```

If tax instalment payments are made every 3 months, we need a year end adjusting entry.

- Case underpaid tax: Either a debit to current tax expense and a credit to income tax payable OR
- Case overpaid tax: Debit to income tax receivable and credit to current tax expense

#### More Current Liabilities

- Cash dividend payable
  - Corporation declared a dividend
  - Stock/shre dividends are not a liability
- Rents and Royalties payable
  - from contractual agreement
- Customer advance and deposits
  - returnable cash deposits or customer advance

### Employee-Related Liabilities

- Payroll deductions
  - Employee income tax
  - Canadian Pension Plan (CPP)
  - Employment Insurance (EI) premiums
  - Union Dues (discretionary)
  - Required employer contributions
    - CPP
    - EI Premium equal 1.4 times employees' EI contribution

```accounting
# employee deduction
Salaries and wages expense                              6,000
  CPP contributions payable                                   500
  EI premiums payable                                            100
  Union dues payable                                                50
  Employee income tax deductions payable        1,500
  Cash 3,                                                                 850
```

```accounting
# employer required
Payroll tax expense     640
  CPP contributions payable         500
  EI premiums payable         140
```

### Short-Term Compensated Absences

- statutory holidays; vacations
- Either **accumulated rights** or **non-accumulating compensated absences** (e.g. paternity leave)

### Profit-Sharing and Bonus Agreements

- regular rates of pay, productivity, or company profits
- obligations are current liabilities

### Decommissioning and Restoration Obligations

- Construction and operation of long-lived assets sometimes create obligations associated with the eventual retirement
- Asset retirement obligation (ARO) or site restoration obligation ; credit
- Recognized in the period incurred
- IFRS
  - constructive (like what is expected by the public) and legal
  - capitalized costs include acquisition only
  - production is inventory or product costs
- ASPE: legal obligations
  - capitalized costs might include all obligations but the production is as they occur
- ARO is a future cost, so capitalize the present value of the cost over the asset's useful life
  - Supposed $600,000 ARO cost and a 8% discount rate in five years. Therefore 600,000 / 1.08 ** 5.
- Incremental ARO costs:
  - IFRS: inventory or production costs
  - ASPE: capitalized
  - Since ARO is a present value, charge Interest Expense under IFRS and Accretion Expense under ASPE
  - Suppose 20% of ARO is because of production-related.
    - Use 80% for the journal entry
    - For IFRS add the ARO production cost to overhead costs and for ASPE debit the drilling platform
  - Straight-line depreciation on the asset over 5 years
    - for IFRS, we know the amount beforehand
    - for ASPE, depends on the incremental capitalized costs
  - Accrue the interest

```accounting
```

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Interest expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
# Under ASPE
Accretion expense 26,134
  ARO                         26,134
```

Suppose that the ARO increased by $88,203 (present value based on the future ARO cost due to the production)

```accounting
# Under IFRS
Inventory     88,203
  ARO             88,203
# Under ASPE
Drilling Platform     88,203
  ARO                              88,203
```

Under IFRS COGS increases whereas under ASPE Depreciation expense will increase subsequent years.

Suppose upon dismantling, there is a higher cash payment that the ARO.

```accounting
across                                      600,000
Loss on Settlement of ARO        10,000
    Cash                                                         610,000
```

### Production Guarantees

Warranty is a promise to correct problems. Expense approach is still used for assurance-type warranties and revenue-approach is for service type warranties.

- Assurance-type warranty: built into the price
- Service-type warranty: separate performance obligation

- expense-approach: expense as occurred but recognize more if total cost > already-recognized expense
  - if there is an estimated warranty cost that was not incurred, expense the remaining estimate as warranty expense as at year-end and into warranty liability
  - deduct expenses related to warranty from the warranty liability account first before recognizing expensing the warranty expense account on income statement
- revenue-approach: recognize unearned revenue, expense as occurred, recognize revenue as performance obligation is satisfied
  - if future warranty cost exceeds unearned revenue, recognize a loss and a liability immediately. (onerous contract)

```accounting
# During the year 2023. Assume 30,000 is the estimated warranty cost.
Accounts receivable 1,000,000
  Revenue 1,000,000
Warranty expense 10,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 10,000
# Adjusting Entries on Dec. 31, 2023:
Warranty expense 20,000
  Warranty liability 20,000
```

```accounting
# As actual warranty costs incur in 2024
Warranty expense 25,000
  Materials, Cash, Payables 25,000
# At year end, we need to adjust the liability account (no longer have liabilities)
# credit warranty expense to liability account
Warranty liability 20,000
  Warranty expense 20,000
```

### Loyalty Programs

- Purchase are partially loyalty points which  is unearned revenue for IFRS 15, optional under ASPE
- $100,000 products purchased, 10,000 points earned, 45% gross profit, 9,500 points to be redeemed
- One point worth $1 distributed for every $10

- Loyalty Points Unearned Revenue = $9,500
- Proportion of goods/services =  $100,000  \* (100,000 + $9,500) = $91,324
- Proportion of loyaty points = 100,000 - 91,324 = 8,676

```accounting
Cash                100,000
Sales revenue               91,324
Unearned revenue        8,676
```

```accounting
COGS      55,000
  Inventory         55,000
```

- Question: when do loyalty points hurt the store?

For expense method, the premiums expense is based off the difference. So (Price - Cost) multiplied by the number of units (redemption and then expected - redemption).

### Contingency

- IFRS:
  - contingent liability: in notes and not recognized
  - **more likely than not** is a provision: this is recognized and is a liability and a loss
  - do not disclose or recognize contingent gains
  - not a provision
- ASPE: likely
  - recognize as loss

### Commitments

- financial guarantee contract.

one party (the guarantor) contracts to reimburse a second party for a loss incurred if a third party (the debtor) does not make required payments when due

- ASPE: Follows the loss contingency standards
- IFRS: Fair Value, MAX(loss allowance, initial). Consider time value of money.

### Financial Statement Analysis

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- ACID test ratio = (cash + marketable securities + net receivables) / current liabilities
- Days payable outstanding = Average trade accounts payable / average daily cost of goods sold or average daily cost of total operating expenses

## Chapter 14

### Long-Term Debt

- Not payable within a year

### Bonds

- Why issue bonds? Capital required is too large for a single lender
- Purchased in small denominations
- Bond indenture (contract)
  - Coupon rate
  - Coupon payment dates
  - Face (par) value
  - [SEC example](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/)
- Issuing company sells bonds to investment banks which markets and sells to investors
- Prospectus filing and subject to securities regulation
  - Do non-publicly traded companies also need to do this
- Private sale does not require filing
- Who pays for rating?

### Common Types of Long-Term Debts

- Registered Bonds
  - Issues in the owner's name
- Bearer Bonds
  - Whoever bears the bonds is owed the money
- Secured debt
  - Mortgage bond or notes
  - Collateral trust bonds
- Income bons
Revenue bonds
- Deep discount bonds or notes
- Commodity-backed debt
- Callable bonds and notes
- Convertible debt

### Defeasance

- When company is not allowed to pay back debt before maturity date,
  - Legal: Give money to a trust to do it for you
  - Creditor agrees accept payment from trust (is this a must?)
  - Creditor gives up its claim to the company
- In-substance defeasance
  - Company does not inform creditor
  - no derecognition

### Bonds Issued at Discount or Premium

To calculate the market price or proceeds, we need to sum the present value of the face value as well as present value of the ordinary annuity. Use a present value factor where periods is the years times the number of payments per year and the rate is the effective interest rate divided by the number of payments per year.

- IFRS: effective interest rate amortization
  - periods = coupons per year \* maturity in years
  - amt = coupon per period not per year
- ASPE: effective interest rate amortization or straight line

```accounting
# fair value transaction
Cash $800,000 Dr.
  Bonds Payable $800,000 Cr.

# Jul 1, 2023
Interest expense $40,000 Dr.
  Cash  $40,000 Cr.

# Dec 31
Interest Expense $40,000 Dr.
  Interest Payable $40,000 Cr.
```

```accounting
# discounted bond of $100,000, 10%C, y=12%
Cash                    $88,700
  Bonds Payables      $88,700
```

```accounting
# Interest expense = beginning carrying amount * effective market yield (divide by number of payments per year)
                               = 88,700 * 12% = $10,644

Dr. Interest expense                               10,644
      Cr. Cash (coupon payment)                          10,000          (=100,000*10%)
      Cr. Bonds payable                                                644
```

### Bonds Issued Between Interest Dates

```accounting
# in this example 10% coupon, semi-annually, 12% yield, $100,000 par value
Dr. Cash                                                    96,750
       Cr. Bonds payable                                     95,083
       Cr. Interest payable             1,667     (= 5,000 x 2/6 )
```

### Zero-interest Bearing Marketable Securities

- marketable meaning money that is given in the future is sold at the present value
- Company issued a bond with face value of 10,000 but the cash proceeds was 7,721.80.

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?7721.80=\frac{10,000}{(1+r)^3}" alt="7721.80 = 10,000 / (1 + r)^3">

### Non-Marketable Instruments with noon-market rates

- Government grant of 100,000 with 10% discount rate?

```accounting
Cash        100,000
  Notes payable   62,092
  Buildings            37,908
```

### Notes Issued for non-cash proceeds (Property, Goods, or Services)

- if marketable security, use the fair value
- otherwise,
  - could discount with cashflow
  - fair value of assets received

### Fair Value Option

- Every period update to fair value
- IFRS: fair value only if it results in more relevant information
- Put unrealized gains in OCI which wil be wiped when debt is paid off
  - Example: Higher credit risk means that the market value of debt is lower (higher return = higher risk)
- ASPE: allows fair value option and no OCI so recognize in net income

### Extinguishment of Debt

- When debt is extinguished, it is derecognized
- Carrying value = maturity value; no gain or loss
- Repayment before maturity date
  - Prior to maturity: reacquisition price
  - Carrying amount = maturity value +- unamortized discount or premium and issuance costs
  - if carrying amount > reacquisition price: gain
  - if reacquisition price > carrying amount: loss

To calculate unamortization amount:

- straight-line method:
  - initial gain/loss divided by the number of years multiplied by number of year remaining on the bond
  - so if buying back a bond at 101 sold at a loss of 24,000 (97 of 800,000) 8 years later with a maturity of 20: `24,000 / 20 * 12 = 14,400`
  - reacquisition price - face value + unamortized amount gain (subtract the loss) = loss/gain
  - 808,000 - (800,000 - 14,400) = 22,400

### Exchange of Debt Instruments

- Refund
- substantially Different terms
- debt < carrying amount
- continuation of debt, with modified terms

1. Transfer non-cash assets
    - recognize a gain/loss on disposal of the non-cash asset
    - gain/loss on debt settlement needs to be recognized
    - creditor may be able to force a transfer (loan foreclosure)
2. Share transfer
3. Issue debt to another creditor, use proceeds to repay existing debt (refinancing)

A building with fair value of $16MM is transferred to settle a $20MM loan.

```accounting
# Creditor
Buildings $16M Dr.
Loss on loan $4M Dr.
  Notes receivable $20M Cr.
```

The building had a book value of $21M

```accounting
# Debtor
Building Depreciation             $5 Dr.
Notes Payable                     $20M Dr.
Loss on Building transfer       $5M Dr.
Buildings                                   $26M Cr.
Gain on Debt Restructuring      $4M Cr.
```

Share transfer

320,000 shares worth $16M is transferred. Creditor is treating it as FV-NI.

```accounting
# Creditor
FV-NI       $16M
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   $4MM  [Allowance for Expected Credit Losses]
  Notes Receivable                       $20M
```

```accounting
# debtor
Notes Payable        $20M Dr.
  Common Shares                   $16M Cr.
  Gain on Debt Restructuring    $4M Cr.
```

### Debt Term Modifications

- Stated interest
- Maturity date
- Face amount
- Reduction or deferral of accrued interest
- Change in currency

For it to be substantial, either the present value changes by at least 10% or the creditor changes.

```txt
On December 31, 2023, Manitoba National Bank enters into a debt restructuring agreement with Resorts Corp., which is experiencing financial difficulties. The current carrying amount of the loan is $10.5 million (the bond was issued at par). The modifications are as follows:
1. Reduce the current obligation from $10.5 million to $9 million.
2. Extend maturity date from Dec 31, 2023 to Dec 31, 2027.
3. Reduce interest rate (annual payment) from 12% to 8% (The current market rate is 9%).

Old terms have a PV of 10,500,000 (because already at maturity).
Use original effective interest to calculate PV of new terms which is 7,906,572.
The difference is ~ 33% so treat it as a settlement.

Notes payable 10,500,000 Dr.
  Notes payable                       8,708,425 Cr.   (market value based on yield and interest rate)
  Gain on Restructuring Debt  1,791,575 Cr.
```

Non-substantial,

- ASPE: Keep carrying amount the same, using the new maturity value and interest rate, solve for EIR, and calculate the new interest expense.
- IFRS: Remeasure carrying amount to the PV using market rate for the new obligations

### Off-Balance Sheet Financing

- Harder to do these days
- Non-consolidated entities
- Special purpose entity or variable interest entity
  - buy assets, take risk, isolate from other company
- operating leases (ASPE only)

### Debt Financial Statement Analysis

- Debt to Asset ratio = Total debt / Total assets
- Times interest earned = Income before taxes nad interest expense / interest expense

## Shareholders' Equity

### Basic Forms

- Proprietorship
  - Single owner
- Partnership
  - Multipler owners
- Corporation
  - >= 1 owner
  - Seperate legal entity
  - Taxed seperately, and personal tax is at dividends
  - Owners only risk investment

### Corporate Classification

- Public / Crown Corporation
  - Government units - no shares
  - Government Business Entreprises - issues shares (e.g. canada post)
- Private Sector
  - Not-for-profit
    - no shares, since no distributions of profits
  - for profit
    - shares issued
    - privately held
    - publicly traded

### Incorporation Process

- Submit articles of incorporation
  - Maximum shares
  - Addresses
  - Directors
  - Share classes

### Shares

- Groups or classes
- Each share is equal to another in the same class
- If no restrictions, there are basic or inherent rights
- CBCA also allows pre-emptive rights
- Basic or Inherent Rights
  - Share proportionally in profits and losses
  - Management (vote for directors)
  - Corporate assets upon liquidation
- Pre-emptive rights
  - allows shareholders to purchase new share issuances
  - protects against involuntary dilution

### Types of Shares

- Common
  - Ownership interest
  - Right to elect board of directors
  - Default share type
- In-Substance Common Shares
  - Similar to common shares BUT cannot be called common shares for account purposes
- Preferred Shares
  - Assurance of dividend before common shares
  - Priority over all other types of shares over earnings and assets upon dissolution
  - No voting rights
  - No share in profit higher than stated rate
  - Features at corporation's discretion:
    - Cumulative in dividend arrears
    - Convertible to common shares
    - Callable/Redeemable at specified dates and prices
    - Retractable - Can sell their shares back to company and mus tbe paid
    - Participating - share in profit distribution
  - CBCA does not allow shares issued with a par value
  - Expressed as a percentage of issue price
  - Shareholder investment cannot be withdrawn at shareholders' discretion unless all prior claims have been paid

### Legality of Dividend Distribution

1. No dividends unless teh corporate capital is kept intact
    - Net assets should be sufficient for solvency purposes
    - CBCA Corporate Solvency Tests
      - After dividend, can the corporation pay its liabilities
      - After dividend, is the realizable value of assets less than total liabilities plus legal capital
        - Portion of company's equity protected by law
2. Dividends must be formally approved by the board of directors
3. Dividends must agree with stipulations in the contracts (debt)

### Issuance of Shares

- Initial Public Offering (IPO)
- Seasoned share issuance

```accounting
# 500 shares at $10
Cash                        $5,000 Dr.
  Common shares       $5,000 Cr.
# 100 preferred shares at $10 per share
Cash                      $1,000 Dr.
  Preferred Shares          $1,000 Cr.
```

### Shares Sold on a Subscription Basis

- Partial payment
- Share only issued until full price received
- Cash already debited
- 10 common shares, at $20, 50 people accept, 50% down, due in 6 months

```accounting
Share subscriptions receivable    $10,000
  Common shares subscribed              $10,000
# first instalment
Cash                                              $5,000
  Share subscriptions receivable          $5,000
# final instalment
Cash  $5,000
  Share subscriptions receivable $5,000
Common shares subscribed        $10,000
  Common shares                               $10,000
```

In case of default, possible actions are:

- refund paid amount

```accounting
Common shares subscribed $1,000
    Share subscription $500
    Accounts Payable $500
```

- treat paid amount as forfeited; transfer to contributed surplus
- issue fewer shares

### Shares issued with other securities

- for lum-sum sales
- relative fair value method
  - estimate fair values of each class of securities, then proportionally allocates the lump-sum to each instrument
- residual value method
  - allocate lump-sum to instruments that are easier to measure, then allocate rest to the other instruments

### Cost of Issuing Shares

- Capital-related (deduct from proceeds)
  - Unerwriting
  - Accounting and legal fees
  - Printing
  - Taxes
- Operation-related (expenses)
  - management
  - maintaining records

### Reacquisition or Repurchases of Shares

- increase ROE
- provide shares for employee share compensation
- business acquisitions or mergers
- stop takeovers
- demand to affect share price
- leverage buy-out (LBO)
- manage regulatory capital requirements
- reacquired shares are either retired or held as treasury shares (inteded for re-issue)
- CBCA required shares to be cancelled and restored status to authorized but unissued
- treasury relatively uncommon in canada

if reacquisition cost < average issuance price

```accounting
Dr. Share capital $1,000
  Cr. Cash $800
  Cr. Contributed Surplus $200
```

if > average issuance price

```accounting
Dr. Share capital          $1,000  (= $10 x 100)
     Cr. Cash                                  $1,200 (= $12 x 100)

Debit $200 to first contributed surplus and then to retained earnings
```

- Share account Book Value per share is the average issuing price

### Dividends

- Date of declaration (board passes resolution)
- Date of record (eligibility of shareholders)
  - business day before ex-dividend date
- Date of payment

- share of earnings
- liquidating dividends (when operations are exhausted, think mining, oil & gas, resource extraction)

### Cash Dividends

Cash dividend of 50 cents a share on 1.8MM shares on July 16 to all shareholders of record on June 24.

```accounting
# after declaration
Dividends Declared (- Equity) $900,000
  Dividends Payable (+ Liability)       $900,000
# nothing on entry date
# payment date
Dividends Payable           $900,000
Cash                                            $900,000
```

### Property (in-kind) Dividends

- Generally measured at fair value of assets given up
- Non-reciprocal transfer of non-monetary assets between an entity and its owners
- Merchandise, real estate, investments

### Stock Dividends

- 1,000 common shares
- $50,000 retained earnings
- $130 per share fair value
- All shareholders received stock dividends

```accounting
# 1000 * 0.1 * 130 = $13,000
# on declaration
Retained earnings   Dr. 13,000
  Stock Dividends Distributable   Cr. 13,000
# on distribution
Stock Dividends Distributable   Dr. 13,000
  Common Shares Cr. 13,000
```

### Liquidating Dividends

- paid out of contributed surplus
- excess of accumulated income considered a return of shareholders' investment
- Example 1.2M dividend with $900,000 considered a return of income

```accounting
Retained Earnings   900,000
Contributed Surplus  300,000
  Dividends Payable         1,200,000
```

### Non-cumulative and Non-participating preferred shares

- Question: is it cheaper to issue bonds or preferred shares
  - Probably bonds since the interest payments are guaranteed and fixed
  - So why would you ever issue a preferred shares if it is more expensive? just because it can be stopped temporarily?
- $50,000 to be distributed as cash dividends
- $400,000 book value
- 1,000 $6 preferred shares out standing with book value of $100,000

```accounting
# non-cumulative preferred shares and non-participating
Total dividends declared $50,000
Less Preferred shares paid first $6,000
Balance available to common shareholders $44,000
# cumulative and non-participating, last 2 years are also due
total dividend declared $50,000
Less: dividends in arrears $12,000
Preferred shares current  $6,000
To common shares:   $32,000
# cumulative and participating
# need to treat the preferred share dividend as if it is part of the proportion so that the proportion of dividends is fair for common
Total dividends declared $50,000
Less; preferred in arrears: 12,000
-----------------------------
Less: preferred 6% 6,000
Less: common 6% 24,000
To preferred (20% of 8,000):  1,600
To common (80% of 8,00): 6,400
```

In case 1, the participation is capped

### Stock Splits vs Stock Dividends

- Lower stock market price = easier to acquire
- If stock dividends are large enough, it's basically a stock split (SEC)
- large stock dividend is more than 20% and is not mentioned about in ASPE and IFRS

### Components of Shareholders' Equity

1. Share capital (provided by shareholders)
2. Contributed Surplus (provided by shareholders)
3. Retained Earnings (earned)
4. Accumulated OCI (earned)

- IFRS: detailed changes in shareholders' equity
- ASPE: only retained earnings, contributed capital in notes

### Capital Disclosure

- Amount of authorized, issued and fully paid shares
- Rights, preferences, any restrictions
- Reconciliation between opening and closing balances
- Restrictions on shares
- IFRS:
- Objectives, policies, processes for managing capital
- Summary quantitative date about what the company manages as capital, and any changes

### Equity Financial Statement Analysis

- ROE = (Net Income - Preferred dividends) / (average common common shareholders' equity)
- Dividend payout (Cash dividends) / (net income - preferred dividends)
- PE ratio = (market price per share) / (earnings per share)
- Book value per share = Common shareholders' equity / number of common shares outstanding

### Derivatives

- effect of transferring the one or more financial risks inherent in the underlying primary instrument
- PV of a forward contract is 0; so no initial investment
- main purpose is for risk management or hedging. Other purposes is speculation and arbitraging.
- Risks: market risk, credit risk (counterparty), and liqduity risk (companies paying off debt obligations)
- Measure at FV-NI
  - remeasure on SFP dates
- Purchase commitments are not derivates unless
  - ASPE: exchange traded futures

A stock warrant gives the holder the right to purchase a company's stock at a specific price and at a specific date. A stock warrant is issued directly by the company concerned; when an investor exercises a stock warrant, the shares that fulfill the obligation are not received from another investor but directly from the company.

Company A has 5,000 shares of Company B and bought 5,000 put options at $2/put option. Strike price is $100 per share (current value).

- Purpose: Company B is willing to lose a maximum of $2 per share and wants to limit the downside to this amount
- Investments (FV-NI). Declines would be posted to net income
- No the accounting is no transparent, because the NI and OCI are different when underlying goes down

### Futures

- Exchange-traded
- Standardized amounts and dates
- Settled through clearing houses
- Requires collateral (margin)
- Settled daily
- G/L Recognized against income

Short $1,000 grain contract settling in 30 days. Initial $100 margin.

```accounting
Derivatives - Deposit   100
  Cash                            100
```

The value of grain increases, so our position decreases (futures contract moved against the company).

```accounting
Gain or Loss                                                50
  Derivatives - Financial Assets/Liabilities      50
```

Suppose there is a margin call for $50

```accounting
Derivatives - Deposit   50
  Cash                            50
```

Settled on net basis

```accounting
Cash              100
Derivatives      50                 (clearing house already settled this to the counterparty)
  Derivatives - Deposit 150
```

### Derivatives Involving the Entity's Own Shares

- IFRS: Fixed-for-fixed equity transaction (gross settlement)
- ASPE: silent, general principles would say contra equity
- When purchasing an options, debit the contributed surplus first

```accounting
Contributed surplus  200
  Cash                              200
```

Company A agrees to purchase $50,000 US for $65,000 CAD in 30 days. There is a fair value of $500 on the issue date.
On settlement the ratio is $1.25 CDN = $1 US (versus 1.3 agreement)

```accounting
Derivatives       500
  Gain or Loss        500
# gross basis settlement
Cash                  62,500
Gain or Loss        3,000
  Cash                             65,000
  Derivatives                         500
# net basis settlement
G/L             3,000
  Cash                      2,500
  Derivatives               500
```

### Hybrid/Compound Investments

- preferred shares
- convertible debt
- redeemable shares
- Debt classification requires meeting financial liabilities definition
  - contractual obligation
  - deliver cash or financial asset to another party
  - potentially unfavourable exchange of financial assets
- Equity:
  - residual interest after deducting liabilities
- Offsetting?
  - Only if there is a legal right and intended to settle
- Measurement
  - Residual value approach (incremental). IFRS. Debt first.
  - Relative fair value (proportional). Equity can be valued as zero or residual method. Easier first
  - debt measured at Amortized cost

### Convertible Debt

- holder has option to exchange for common shares
- raise capital without giving up ownership
- lower interest rate, since investors can ride on share value increase
- B corp. offers 3-year, 6% annual coupon, convertible bonds par = $1000. Convertible to 250 shares trading at $3/share. Similar straight line bonds carry an interest rate of 9%. 1,000 bonds are issued at par.
