It is time for me to say farewell to Firefox. Your web developer toolling will be missed, however your memory hogging, startup speed, and performance will not be missed.

Today is a great day, because I was able to compare Edge vs. Firefox with the average browser load I have while developing. The other day I had 59 tabs open while developing but today I had just 6 and Firefox was taking 1.7GB of memory. I opened these tabs on Edge, and the memory footprint was 200MB less after subtracting the extensions memory used by Firefox. Edge was running a theme with a QHD image and also had uBlock origin installed.

After I switched, I tested the speed it took to load this blog and my personal website. The difference is small but noticeable.

It sucks that I am the creator of some of the most used Firefox themes, however, I don't participate in tribalism. I simply use the software that maximizes my productivity, and it only takes a couple minutes to switch a browser these days.
