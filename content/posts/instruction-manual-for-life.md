This is an ongoing article on how to raise a child (not necessarily yours) and how to grow as a person. As a child grows, they generally become or should become more self-aware and conscious. Maturity means that they are able to think more than one-step ahead for 99% of actions. Being an adult does not imply you are mature. Maturity is also not about never having fun or never laughing.

For me, this was probably at the start of grade 11. I distinctly remember not trying at all in Grade 12 chemistry during the summer going into Grade 11. However, once in Grade 11, I got serious about most of my courses.

## 18th to 24rd year of life

At this point in life, you should be preventing yourself from ending up in a bad situation once you are 25 years old.
This article is about getting through in life, and the easiest way to get through in life is to not put yourself in situations that could result in a significant setback. A bad situation can ALWAYS lead to a worse one. For me, death is not a rock bottom. Death is not the worst that can happen.

## 17th year of life

This is when you are told to pick something to do after high-school. What you aren't told to do is to think approximately where you see yourself in 10 years.

I will operate from the point of view that I have parents but we have no money, and that I live in America, the country with the
highest education costs. This way, you can tailor the advice to your own environment.

I want to figure out the minimum income needed for me to be independent, and the entry income I would require.
Free will and freedom of choice is not all butterflies and rainbows. The disease waiting is that you can make the wrong choice.

You may have a choice in what you want to do, but you need to be aware of how it'll impact your life later on.

With that said, I would go for Computer Science at a community college.

It is not about what you want to do. You can want to do something, but we don't live in a fantasy so you need to be rooted in reality.

You do not have to go to University, and if your degree won't get you a median paying job ($55,000) you should definitely go to (Community) College. Even at this salary, you should be thinking about ways to increase your economic situation.

Let us delve into the degrees that won't pay the bills

- criminal justice
- public policy and law
- performing arts
- leisure and hospitality
- anthropology

All these degrees have unemployment rates more than 50%. However, even if you choose the right degree, you'll need to make sure you are capable of learning the skills for it.

Computer science has the lowest unemployment and its 26%! That means a quarter of people in computer science didn't learn anything or aren't finding jobs.

The supply of labour is definitely higher than the demand for it. The solution is a bit complicated.

If you are interested in these topics that don't pay, do not worry. I learned how to code all by myself without paying a dime, so you can learn these topics through alternative means as well. Probably not for free, but khan academy and skillshare are very cheap. And if that's not possible, you can go to community college (simply colleges in Canada) rather than university. The goal is to reduce the cost of learning. Next you need to humble yourself. Having a degree doesn't imply intelligence nor skills, so you'll need to humble yourself for when you are looking for jobs.

Okay so maybe you've decided to not go for those degrees but aren't interested in the lower unemployment jobs. Well your still not out of luck. The pathway then would either be trades (probably not), or you start working immediately.

What I realized is that there are a lot of white collar entry jobs like being a secretary or a front office worker that aren't pushed a lot. This is probably due to failures in job board sorting and filters. Anyways, you should use a niche job board that can find entry level office jobs that don't require a degree. These jobs will pay at least $5 more than minimum wage and are a good start at earning some money. How you spend your free time will be crucial to how you progress from here. For starters, there are people without degrees and millionaires. Do you have a hobby you are good at? Art? Monetization is the goal. I wish I was good at digital art, because then I would take advantage of this nft craze. That's easy money right there and if you don't want to feel like you are scamming the delusional nft buyers, you can charge a reasonable amount ($250 - $1,500). Nfts can have royalty payments do even after the initial sales, you'll get kick backs. Now before you go spouting off about your environment ethics, please keep an open mind. The cost of environment for human wants/needs is a valid one. Otherwise the industrial revolution would never have happened and you wouldn't be reading this article.

Okay but maybe you're very very anti crypto. That's fine because you can sell art the normal way, online. The cost will be $10/month not including the domain and ssl. You can use Shopify or squarespace as you might not be interested in woocomerce nor magneto. And definitely not a custom website. I don't recommend wix.

Lastly, you can sacrifice your dignity and go into controversial industries. Tiktok and the military are just the tip of the ice berg. I won't name the other ones but I'm sure you can come up with them. All legal by the way, so don't think I'm talking about drugs ðŸ˜‚.

My final point is this. Art and anything related to digital content, is deflationary similar to technology although for different reasons. As time progresses, the amount of content increases, but the amount of consumers does not keep up. Intuitively, mediocre art gets cheaper every year and only top quality or famous artists get the money. This concept is hardly talked about but will be very important 50 years down the line when people don't have enough time in the world to watch the greatest TV shows and movies. They won't have enough time to get through their massive music playlists either.

## 15th year of life

Get a part time job and start saving your money. My friend worked at Time Hortons for a couple years and had saved C$20,000 by the time of university. This combined with OSAP let him go to school comfortably.

That's not to say you can't spend your money. The max amount of money you want to spend is $3,000 over 3 years.

### Things to buy

Best time to buy things is near/on Black Friday. There is a myth going around that prices are jacked befeore Black Friday to
simulate you are getting a deal, but this is false. Black Friday, Cyber Money, and 1 day before Christmas Eve have the best deals.

- PC (custom or prebuilt). When I built my PC, I skimped on parts because I did not want to wait for a paycheck
  - For storage buy at least a 2TB NVME m.2
  - For processor buy at least an i7 or AMD Ryzen 7
  - For GPU, buy at least an NVIDA *60 or AMD equivalent
  - For peripherals, buy from Best Buy or Canada Computers so you can try them out
    - Also buy a headset
  - Motherboard should be Wi-FI compatible
  - Monitor
    - New: 1080p 144hz
    - Used: 4k (do not get QHD, they are overpriced)

## 14th year of life

This is the age I wish I had started to learn how to program.
I learned how to program in August 2016, when I was 14.5 years old. It may seem like I was early, but it's not optimal.
An extra year goes a long way, and I feel that if I had started learning a year before, I would be even smarter presently.
Starting too early would result in an ego too big to be authentic and not big enough to be humble. I've witnessed it myself.

## 13th year of life

I think this is when you start doing your life guarding course. Only do life guarding course if you are born before July.
The programs discriminate based on age rather than birth year, so you'd end up as a life guard for only half the required time!

However, you can volunteer at the community centre for swimming programs without any courses.

## Before 13

This is the time to instill discipline in your child. Discipline in terms of physical health, intelligence, and ethics. Discipline is not teaching religion and projecting your personal beliefs.

If I had children, I would put them in a cardiovascular activity to do after school. On weekends, I would take them swimming; A sport and a fun activity.

In terms of intelligence, the principles of mathematics are perfect. Just make sure you can teach them properly because not everyone can teach. Your child should be able to multiple single digit numbers in their heads by grade 3. Memorization is not the ability to multiply! Going further, your child should be able to subtract double digit number in their head by the time they are in high school.
