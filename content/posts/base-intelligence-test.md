Let's start with a classic.

1. If you are going 120 km/h, how long does it take to go 120 km.

    This question is easy. It should take 1 second to answer.

2. If you are going 120 km/h, how many hours does it take to go 40 km?

    This question is medium. It is designed to test basic mental math.
    A child in grade 6 should be able to do it.

3. If you are going 100 km/h, how many hours does it take to go 55 km (decimal answer)?

    This question tests the ability to understand 0s and percents.

4. Which sentence is more correct?

    1. Elijah was unable to fail the test.
    2. Elijah passed the test.

    This is a grammar question, no one should get this wrong.

5. Being good at math makes someone intelligent.

    The answer is no. Freebie. This question is meant for people who are smart but might not be intelligent.
