No one is talking about the problem of Muslims and Hindus on the Indian subcontinent.
The problem is scoped on Kashmir and the temple site.

## Kashmir

Kashmir will never be independent of both Pakistan and India because they would require
a civilian militia which won't be effective since even Bangladesh did not gain independence alone.

So for Kashmir, there are two scenarios

a) If India backs off, Pakistan will invade
b) India won't defend another country for free

In this first section, we'll determine which country, India or Pakistan, would benefit Kashmiris more.

### Language

- If Kashmir becomes part of Pakistan, the people of Kashmir would be forced to learn Urdu and so over time they will lose their own \[Kashmiri] language.
- If Kashmir becomes part of India, the people there will be free to speak their own language.

On this topic, it is my opinion that countries should adopt two official langues, the culturally dominant one as well as English.
English, French, and German are the languages required for success. Out of these three, English is the most international and its used all over the internet.
Most website were made English first, meaning that it is English which is the source for the translations. Is it better to understand through a translation or by comprehending
the source material?

## Ayodhya

On Ayodhya, read the case summary. The Muslims could not prove that the land was theirs and the Hindus had been worshipping in there for over a century. If someone isn't enforcing their property rights, the land transfers to the squatter. Therefore, it makes sense that the land was given to build a temple. The court did see that the Muslims wanted a mosque so they were given 5 acres of land compared to the 2.77 that they "lost". The mosque was demolished illegally in 1992, so it's ridiculous to say that 2.77 acres holds more value than 5 acres when that area was previously occupied for a different purpose. It's more ridiculous when you realize Muslims aren't allowed to destroy temples of other religions. The fact that a case that has a verdict is still being argued is pathetic.
