draft: true
summary: "This post values Daqo New Energy Corp (DQ), a polysilicon producer, arguing it's undervalued as its net tangible value exceeds its market cap. It notes the stock price correlates with polysilicon prices in China, which hit lows in 2024. The author is bullish due to DQ's market position and expected recovery in China's economy. Using conservative assumptions (price per ton, useful life, profit margin), a rough valuation suggests a fair price around $4.43-$4.90, making it a buy for risk-seekers."

The first stock that I consider undervalued is DQ.

Currently trading at $19.00, and $17.13 before China stimulus announcement, this is a stock that has a net tangible value greater than its equity market cap. That's right, if the company was liquidated today, shareholders (of which a big chunk is management), would receive more money than selling shares on the public market.

The price of shares is correlated with the price of [polysillicon within China](https://www.bernreuter.com/polysilicon/price-trend/). 2024 has seen the worst prices of polysillicon such that DQ is no longer profitable. Note that DQ [products](https://www.dqsolar.com/Products) includes the superior N-type.

The reason why I'm bullish on DQ and polysillicon prices is because:

1. DQ is one of the largest suppliers and has the cash to stay in the market longer than its competitors,
2. China's economy has been in a recession for a long time and so lower prices of these materials is due to lower domestic demand throughout the economy. The fact that China's stimulus cheques send DQ's stock upwards is evidence of this.

## Entry and Exit Prices

Buy under $20, re-balance at $25 and $30, sell price is at least $50 (200% return).
