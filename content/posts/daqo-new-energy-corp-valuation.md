In my quest to determine whether I can outperform a pre-construction condo at 101 Spadina, I have decided to properly compare investing $40,000 and $80,000 in a basket of undervalued stocks versus using this money for two deposits and earning APRs of 8% and 3% respectively.

The first stock that I consider undervalued is DQ.

Currently trading at $19.00, and $17.13 before China stimulus announcement, this is a stock that has a net tangible value greater than its equity market cap. That's right, if the company was liquidated today, shareholders (of which a big chunk is management), would receive more money than selling shares on the public market.

The price of shares is correlated with the price of [polysillicon within China](https://www.bernreuter.com/polysilicon/price-trend/). 2024 has seen the worst prices of polysillicon such that DQ is no longer profitable. Note that DQ [products](https://www.dqsolar.com/Products) includes the superior N-type.

The reason why I'm bullish on DQ and polysillicon prices is because:

1. DQ is one of the largest suppliers and has the cash to stay in the market longer than its competitors,
2. China's economy has been in a recession for a long time and so lower prices of these materials is due to lower domestic demand throughout the economy. The fact that China's stimulus cheques send DQ's stock upwards is evidence of this.

## Entry and Exit Prices

Buy under $20, re-balance at $25 and $30, sell price is at least $50 (200% return).
