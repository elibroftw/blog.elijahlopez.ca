Voting is done out of self-interest, therefore, this article's purpose to objectively figure out why women are generally more left leaning than men. That isn't to say that women can't be conservative, the article is here to figure out what is keeping women from voting for conservative parties.

The biggest reason is abortion and women's rights. Some conservative parties still tolerate pro-abortion candidates, like Conservative Party of Canada.

It's like telling me to vote for NDP when I know Jagmeet Singh is a Khalistani supporter. If I was a woman, it wouldn't matter if the CPC is running on a platform unrelated to abortion, it's a huge issue. Likewise, it doesn't matter if the NDP is running on a platform that has nothing to do with Khalistan, it's a huge issue to me that there is any connection at all!

To explain the other differences, it's a sum of the parts. If you look at all the categories where a person should have a left leaning bias out of self-interest, all of these categories (not limited to) have significant gender gaps.

There's many topics that contain self-interests where there's a gender gap. If you add them all up a political gap is justified. I do not believe it's just "women like one thing and therefore that's why they are left leaning"

1. men outearn women even after adjusting for discrimination due to career paths. Recent trends show that women are outearning men, so will be interesting to see the CPC.
2. women are over represented in federal public services (56.8% are women vs 49% full-time employed over 25, that's an entire 7%), and probably in all public services aside from federal government (e.g. teachers)
3. women overrepresented in disability. Compared to men, there are six percent more women are more likely to be left leaning out of self-interest. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-654-x/89-654-x2024001-eng.htm
4. People with mental illness are more left leaning than the average person, and women are more likely to be mentally ill.
That's 4 categories I can come up with on the spot. I'm sure
6. Women living longer and therefore care less about policies that benefit the middle working class

Another question to explore and is correlated: Why do women care more about Climate Change and net zero than men. Or I guess the other way is why do men care less about climate change and net zero than women?

Why do men have more of a lack of conscientiousness? https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1776422/Why_do_women_care_more_about_the_environment_than_men.pdf

I can't find any reason why they lack it more than women,

> Women score somewhat higher than men on some facets of Conscientiousness, such as order, dutifulness, and self-discipline
