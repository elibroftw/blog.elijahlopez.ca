summary: "Discover the most efficient way to handle parallel and concurrent network requests in Python. Learn why ThreadPoolExecutor outperforms asyncio for network-bound tasks and see a practical proof of concept."

You’d think that the fastest way to make parallel network requests would be to use asyncio, but it’s actually `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
I’ve known ThreadPools before as I worked with them in Java 6+ months ago, but I couldn’t find something similar in Python until yesterday.
There is also a `ProcessPoolExecutor`, but I’d only suggest you use that for CPU-bound tasks.
ThreadPoolExecutor is better since requests are network bound (and also because I encountered a jumbled error when I tried to use `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
Here is a quick proof of concept using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

I hope that the comments in the code above were enough but if not, please let me know.
