Programming isn't taught well. No one is teaching software development to kids so that they succeed in the future.

Examples:

Leta start with the basics. If I had a mentee who I believe was smart, I'd want them to become the most legendary programmer ever. I'd teach them three things. Python for scripts, automation, and last resorts. Cross platform c++ for efficiency, lifetime success, and raising c++ code quality standards. I'd teach them html, css, Javascript, and react so that they can build a UI that users and themselves would enjoy using. Next I'd teach them the nuisances so that they can distribute their code. How to automate distribution of: desktop apps and server apps. This would go over to things. One is how to compile for all platforms using VM or someone else's VM servers (GitHub actions), how to take that app and distribute it (via github releases or an ec2 like bucket), how to deploy server apps, how to keep server apps up to date, how to scale server apps without coding too much.

- Learning Java but forced to use eclipse, not taught about maven nor grade.
- learning python but data structures like dict and set are ignored and use cases are ignored
- learning c++ and bash for scripting; python was ignored, c++ only taught make, not CMake, not cross platform code, no dependency management, so I taught myself vcpkg a year later, and will learn about Conan later

Haskell for functional programming
