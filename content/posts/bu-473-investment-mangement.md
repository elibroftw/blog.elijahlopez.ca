  - Future: obligation, option: right

## Securities Trading

### How Firms Issue Securities

- Initial Public Offerings
  - Road show to publicize new offering
  - Bookbuilding to determine demand
  - Degree of investor interest provides valuable pricing information
  - Underwriter bears price risk
    - IPOs are commonly underpriced
      - Twitter
    - Some IPOs are well overpriced
      - Facebook
        - Retail investor interest lasts only for 2 days. Institutions always drive volume

over-allotment: when all equity is sold so banks want more to sell

underwriter takes the risk

### Types of Orders

- Market order: buy or sell
- price-contingent order:
  - Limit buy (sell) order to buy at below (above) specified price
- large order filled at multiple prices

### Trading Strategies

- Algorithmic trading
- High-frequency trading
  - HIgh volume low profit
- Dark pools
  - private trading systems in which participants can buy or sell large blocks of securities without showing their hand

### Trading Costs

- Explicit cost
  - Commission
- Implicit costs
  - Dealer's bid-ask spread
  - Price concession an investor may be forced to make for big quantities
  - Buying board lots is prioritized than fractional

### Trading with Margin and Short Sales

- Initial margin is usually 50%
  - Maintenance margin
  - When equity is 30%, add more money
  - How far can a stock price fall before a margin call?

- P = Purchase Price * (1 - initial margin) / (1 - maintenance margin)

- equity required = initial margin *  value - value  + borrowed = 1,800
- equity total required = 0.6 * value

### Leverage

Multiplier effect

### Short Sale

Benefit when price goes down.

### Insider Trading

- Someone trading on information not profitable
- Most common is spouse of someone on legal team

### Questions

A t-bill has a bank discount yield of 6.81% based on teh ask price and 6.9% based on the bid price. The maturity of the bill is 60 days. Find the bid and ask prices of the bill.

Convert 6.81% and 6.9% for 60 days. 360 days in a year

- 1000 - 1000 * 0.0681 * 60 / 360 = 988.65
- 1000 - 1000 * 0.069 * 60 / 360 = 988.5
- Therefore the bid-ask spread is just $0.15

A u.s. treasury bill with 90-day maturity sells at a bank discount yield of 3%.

a. what is the price of the bill?
b. what is the 90-day holding period return of the bill?
c. what is the bond-equivalent yield of the bill?
d. what is the effective annual yield of the bill

<details><summary>answer</summary>

a. 1000 - 1000 \* 0.03 \* 90 / 360 = 992.5
b. 1000 / 992.5 = 0.756%
c. 365 days instead of 360: yield = (1000 - 992.5) / 992.5 * 365 / 90 = 3.06%
d. 1.00756 \*\* (365/90) - 1 = 3.1%

Purchase 300 shares of GameStart at $40/share. Borrows $4,000 from her broker to
 help pay for the purchase. Interest rate on loan is 8%.

a. What is the margin of Dei's account when she first purchases the stock?
b. share price falls to $30 per share, what is the remaining margin (equity)
on the account?
c. margin requirement is 30%, will a marign call occur?
d. What is the rate of return?

<details><summary>answer</summary>

a. (300 \* 40 - 4,000) / 300 \* 40 = (12,000 - 4,000) / 12,000 = 66.7%
b. 4000 \* 1.08 = 4680
c. 4680 / 9000 = 48% > 30%, so no
d. (4680 - 8000) / 8000 = -41.50%

</details>

Price rose $10. Stock paid dividend of $2.

a. What is remaining margin?
b. 30% margin requirement
c. rate of return?

<details><summary>answer</summary>

a. Initial equity is 50% \* 4,000 = 20,000.
Final equity is 20000 + (40 - 50 - 2) \* 1000 = 8,000
b. 8000 / (50 * 1000) = 16%, so yes
c. (8000 - 20000) / 20000 = -60%

</details>

- Cross-market arbitrage
- Electronic market making
- Electronic "front running"

Examples

1. An open-end fund has a net asset value of $10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of 6%. What is the offering price?

- $10.70 after offering price, so offering price = 10.70 / 0.094 = 11.38

2. The offering price is 12.30 with a front-end load of 5%. What is the NAV? NAV = 12.30 \* 0.95 = $11.69

3. You purchased 1,000 shares at $20 with a front-end load of 4%. Securities increased in value by 12%. There is a 1.2% expense ratio. What is the rate of return?

OFF = 20 / 0.96 = 20.83

Final value = 20  \* 1.12 \* (1 - 0.012) = 22.13

Rate of return = 22.13 / 20.83 - 1 = 6.24%

4. Loaded-up fund has an expense ratio of 1.75%. Economy Fund has a front-end load of 2% but an expense ratio of 0.25%. Assume rate of return is 6% before any fees.

- LU = 1000 \* 1.06 \* (1 - 0.0175) = 1041.45 -> 4.1%
- EF = 1000 \* (1 - 0.98) \* 1.06 \* (1 - 0.0025) = 1036.20 -> 3.62%

## Risk & Return

- Rate of return on zero-coupon bond; r = (100/Price) - 1
  - r = (FV/PV)^(1/m) - 1
- Annual Percentage (Posted) Rate (APR)
- Effective annual rate (EAR):
  - Takes into consideration the effects of compounding
  - (1 + APR/n)^n - 1
  - Example
    - APR of 4.5%, m = 4
    - 100((1 + 0.045/4)^4 - 1)  = 4.58%
    - What if you want 4.58%?
    - Bank A: 4.58% APR, m = 1
    - Bank B: 4.5%, m = 4
    - Bank C: APR if compound is 12?
      - 12 \* (1.0458 ^ (1/12) - 1)  = 4.4867%
    - Continuous compounding
      - FV = euler's constant ^ (rt)
      - For a EAR of 4.58%, ln (1 + 4.58%) = r -> r = 4.475%

<img class=equation-tall src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?EAR=(1+\frac{APR}{n})^n">

### Interest Rates and Inflation Rates

- Nominal rate is the growth of your money = 11.5%
- Next year, you get 1.115
- Coffee is $1 today, but given an [Average annual rate of inflation](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/) of 3.5%, the coffee will be 1.035.
- You could buy 1 coffee now and 1.077 next year
- Change in purchasing power = return return = 1.077 / 1 - 1 = 7.7%
- Fisher equation: N approxEqal to real return + inflation
- Return = (1 + N) / (1 + inf) - 1

- Equilibrium rate of return

### RIsk and Risk Premium

- Holding Period Return = (enter price - enter price + dividend) / (enter price) = Capital Gain Yield + Dividend Yield
- E(r) = sum of probability of state + return if state occurs
- Variance:
- Standard Deviation (STD)

| State | Prob. of State | r in State | Weighted r | Var |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Excellent | .25  | 0.3100                | (25)(.31)  | (3.1% - 9.76%)^ (.25) |
| Good | .45  | 0.1400                  | (.45)(.14)  | (14% - 9.76%)^ (.45) |
| Poor | .25  | -0.0675                 | (.25)(-0.0675)  | (6.75% - 9.76%)^ (.25) |
| Crash | .05 | -0.5200                  | (.05)(-.52)  | (-5% - 9.76%)^ (.05) |
| Total | 1 | N/A | 9.76% | 0.038

- STD = sqrt(0.038) = 19.49%
- Based on a normal distribution, we can expect a return of 9.76% +- 19.49% 68% of the time.
- Risk: likelihood of something happening and magnitude
- STD gives us both the magnitude and the likelihood
- Look at historical returns, and calculate the STD of those returns to get the

- Skewness: positively skewed means a tail on the right
- Kurtosis: how normally distributed data is (fatness of the curve)

### Calculating the STD of a Stock Tutorial

1. Download monthly data for 5 years from yahoo finance
2. Keep only date and adjusted Close columns. Adjusted close factors dividends.
3. Make a column called r and use the formula (=X4/X3-1)
4. Calculate average of the rates
5. Create a column called variance and use the formula (=(X3 - $AVERAGE$RATE)^2)
    - Or use the VAR formula in Excel
6. Calculate the variance which is the SUM of the column divided by the number of rates MINUS 1
    - In a sample, 1 is subtracted to remove the bias to the mean
7. Square root the variance to ge the standard deviation of the monthly return
8. You can skip the manual calculations and use the VAR and STD formulas provide by Excel.
9. You can get the SKEW of the data by using the SKEW function on the returns
10. Manually calculating the SKEW
    - Create a column and instead of squaring the deviation, cube it
    - Divide by the number of rates MINUS 1, and then multiply by the standard deviation cubed
11. Use =KURT to get the kurtosis of the rates
    - 3 is NORMAL
    - The lowe the Kurtosis the tighter in the middle

### Risk Measures

- Value at risk
  - Loss that will be incurred in the event of an extreme adverse price change change with some given, usually low, probability. Typically, use 1st percentile
  - -2.33 STD
  - 9.76 - 2.33 \* 19.49 = -35.65%
- Expected Shortfall (ES)
- Lower partial standard deviation (LPSD)

## Capital Allocation

- Risk-averse investors consider only risk-free or speculative prospects with positive risk premiums
- Portfolio is more attractive when its expected return is higher, and its risk is lower
  - what happens when risk increases along with return

### Utility Values

- U = Utility Value
- E(r) = Expected return
- A = Index of the investor's risk aversion
- Variance of returns
- Scaling factor of 0.5 (half year)

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?U=E(r)-0.5A\sigma^2">

### Investor Types

- Risk-averse: want compensation for risk via a premium. A > 0;
- Risk-neutral; A =0
- Risk-lovers; A < 0

### Mean-Variance Criterion

- E(rA) >= E(rB)
- STD_A <= STD_B

### Capital Allocation Across Risky and Risk-Free Portfolios

- Manipulate the % invested in risk-free vs risk portfolio

Total market value: $300,000, risk-free: $90,000.

- Equities: 113,400
- Bonds: 96,600

90 day T-bill is considered the risk-free asset.

### One Risky Asset and a Risk-Free Asset Portfolios

- Reward-to-volatility ratio (aka Sharpe ratio)
  - Excess return vs. portfolio standard deviation

y\* = ( E(rp) - rf )/ A std^2 = 41.3%

Indifference curves + Capital Allocation Line

To find the weighting to invest in the risky and risk-free portfolio.

Now we get optimal allocation for any portfolio.

### Diversification and Portfolio Risk

- Market risk
  - Market-wide risk source
  - Remains even after diversification
  - Also called systemic or non-diversifiable
- Firm-specific risk
  - Risk that can be eliminated by diversification
  - Also called non-systematic risk

Standard deviation cannot drop below a certain line due to market risk. Portfolio risk could be reduced to only 19.2%.
At 20 stocks, the marginal benefit is very small. Between 20-40 securities, the marginal benefit is needless.

### Two Risky Assets

- Covariance of two assets = correlation \* stdD \* stdE
- Variance of rp = wE^2rE^2 + wB^2rB^2 + 2COV(rb, re) wDwE

| State | Prob. of State | r D | r E | COV(rD, RE) |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| B | 25%  | 2% | -5% | .25\*(2%- E(rd)) (5% - E(re)) |
| N | 50%  | 5% |  15% |.25\*(5%- E(rd)) (15% - E(re))  |
| G | 25%  | 8% | 30%  |.25\*(8%- E(rd)) (30% - E(re))  |
| Total | 1 | E(rd) | E(re) | Cov(rd, re)

You need to covariance or the correlation to find the standard deviation.

- pDE = COV(Rd, re) / (rD \* rE)
- 1.0 <= p <= 1.0
- no diversification if pDE = 1
- if pDE = -1, you can get the weights using wE = stdD / (stdD + stdE) = 1 - wD

### Graphing Risk

- Straight line between two assets if the correlation is 1
- With perfect hedge (-1), there are two straight lines going to risk = 0
- In between, risk is never 0 but a sideways parabola
- Find std for the portfolio for every weighting to get a risk allocation
- **Minimum variance portfolio**: portfolio allocation with the lowest risk, but not the optimum
  -wE = ( rB^2 - COV(rB, rE) ) / (rB^2 + rE^2 - 2COV(rB, rE))
- Calculate the slope of all portfolios
  - (Expected return of portfolio - risk free rate) / risk of portfolio \* A
  - A = risk appetite
- Calculate the slope of the capital allocation line
- **Tangent portfolio** or **Optimum portfolio**
  - Point where the capital allocation line is tangent to the weighting

### Minimum Variance Portfolio

<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?wA=\frac{r_B^2-COV(r_B,r_A)}{r_B^2+r_A^2-2COV(r_B,r_A)}">

### Chapter 7 Problems

1. Three mutual funds: first is a stock fund, second is a long-term government and corporate bond fund, third is a T-bill fund with 8% yield. The covariance is 0.1 between the two risky funds.

| Fund | Expected Return |Standard Deviation |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Stock | 20% | 30%        | (25)(.31)  |
| Bond | 12%  | 15%        | (25)(.31)  |

a. what are the investment proportions in the minimum-variance portfolio
    - Using the formula, we get wE =17.39% and wB = 82.61%
b. what is the expected value and standard deviation of the minimum variance portfolio rate of return
    - Expected return is then 13.39%
    - Standard deviation (square root of portfolio variance) is then 13.92% (the formula uses covariance)
c. what are the weights, expected return, and standard deviation of the optimal risky portfolio?
    - **wB = (Excess return of the bond \* rE^2 - Excess return of equity \* Cov(rE, rB)) / ( excess return of rB \* rE^2 + excess return of equity \* rB^2 - \[excess return of B + excess return of E]Cov(rB, rE))**
    - wB = 54.8%, wE = 45.2%
    - expected rp = 15.61%
    - STD(rp) = 16.54%
    - What if you wanted to use the risk free?
    - expected return of complete portfolio = 14%
    - expected return of complete portfolio = wFrF + wPrP
    - 14% = (1-wF)8% + wp15.61%
    - 14 - 8 / 15.61 - 8 = wp
    - wp = 78.84

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

- Capital Allocation Line becomes Capital Market Line or Securities Market Line

Assumptions

1. Individual behaviour
    - Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers
    - Their common planning horizon is a single period
    - Investors all use identical input lists, (homogenous expectations). Publicly available information.
2. Market structure
    - Publicly held and public exchanges
    - Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities
    - No taxes
    - No transaction costs

### The Market Portfolio

- Market weighted all securities (proxy = SP500 index)

- Beta is the correlation with the market risk
- Required return of a stock = risk free + beta of the stock times the excess return of the market
- Beta = slope of the line of best fit or COV(individual, market) / variance of the market

- required return goes up when a stock is sold because of the dividend discount model (dividend yield increases).
- alpha is the difference between actual return and expected return
- track alpha in order to determine if the model is actually working or not

### Extensions of the CAPM

1. Identical input lists
2. ZEro-beta model
3. Labour income and other Nontraded assets

### Chapter 9 Problems

1. What must be the beta of a portfolio with expected return  of a portfolio of 18%, if risk free is 6% and expected market return is 14%?

Beta = (18% - 6%) / (14% - 6%) = 1.5

2.  T-bill rate is 4%, market risk premium is 6%. What is the fair return?
    - $1 Discount store: 12%  forecasted, 8% std, beta = 1.5
        - Fair return is 4% + 1.5 \* 6% = 13%
    - Everything $5: 11% expected, 10%, beta is 1.0
        - Fair return is 10%

3.

| Scenario | Market Return |Aggressive Stock|Defensive Stock|
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| A | 5% | -2% | 6%  |
| B | 25%  | 38% |12%  |

What are the betas? Use rise over run to calculate the slope using the two scenarios as data points.
    - (38 - (-2)) / (25 - 5) = 2
    - (12 - 6)(25 - 5) = 6/20

What is the expected return on each stock if market returns are equally likely?
    - Give each scenario a 50% weighting

If the T-bill is 6%, and the market return is equally likely the be 5% 25%, draw the SML for this economy.
    - E(rm) = 15%
    - Draw a line from 6% to 25% when Beta is 1

Plot the two securities on the SML graph. What are the alphas of each? Characterize each company in the above table as underpriced, overpriced, or properly priced.
    - alpha is .3% for the defensive, -6% for the aggressive

### Assignment 2

- Actively managed
- Must have to modify at least twice
  - Propose modifications
