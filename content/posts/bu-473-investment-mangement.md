### Questions

A t-bill has a bank discount yield of 6.81% based on teh ask price and 6.9% based on the bid price. The maturity of the bill is 60 days. Find the bid and ask prices of the bill.

Convert 6.81% and 6.9% for 60 days. 360 days in a year

- 1000 - 1000 * 0.0681 * 60 / 360 = 988.65
- 1000 - 1000 * 0.069 * 60 / 360 = 988.5
- Therefore the bid-ask spread is just $0.15
