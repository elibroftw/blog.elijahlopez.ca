      - Twitter
    - Some IPOs are well overpriced
      - Facebook
        - Retail investor interest lasts only for 2 days. Institutions always drive volume

over-allotment: when all equity is sold so banks want more to sell

underwriter takes the risk

- equity required = initial margin *  value - value  + borrowed = 1,800
- equity total required = 0.6 * value

### Questions

A t-bill has a bank discount yield of 6.81% based on teh ask price and 6.9% based on the bid price. The maturity of the bill is 60 days. Find the bid and ask prices of the bill.

Convert 6.81% and 6.9% for 60 days. 360 days in a year

- 1000 - 1000 * 0.0681 * 60 / 360 = 988.65
- 1000 - 1000 * 0.069 * 60 / 360 = 988.5
- Therefore the bid-ask spread is just $0.15

c. 365 days instead of 360: yield = (1000 - 992.5) / 992.5 * 365 / 90 = 3.06%
d. 1.00756 \*\* (365/90) - 1 = 3.1%

Examples

1. An open-end fund has a net asset value of $10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of 6%. What is the offering price?

- $10.70 after offering price, so offering price = 10.70 / 0.094 = 11.38

2. The offering price is 12.30 with a front-end load of 5%. What is the NAV? NAV = 12.30 \* 0.95 = $11.69

3. You purchased 1,000 shares at $20 with a front-end load of 4%. Securities increased in value by 12%. There is a 1.2% expense ratio. What is the rate of return?

OFF = 20 / 0.96 = 20.83

Final value = 20  \* 1.12 \* (1 - 0.012) = 22.13

Rate of return = 22.13 / 20.83 - 1 = 6.24%

4. Loaded-up fund has an expense ratio of 1.75%. Economy Fund has a front-end load of 2% but an expense ratio of 0.25%. Assume rate of return is 6% before any fees.

- LU = 1000 \* 1.06 \* (1 - 0.0175) = 1041.45 -> 4.1%
- EF = 1000 \* (1 - 0.98) \* 1.06 \* (1 - 0.0025) = 1036.20 -> 3.62%
