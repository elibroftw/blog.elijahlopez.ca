This article is a precise guide on why someone should care about climate change and then what to do about or how to fix it.
I predict that the fix will be controversial but alas drastic measures get results. The solutions section is currently being worked on.

## Is Climate Change Real?

There's two parts to this question. Is the climate changing \[drastically] and if it is, are a subset of human activities the main driver of significant climate change? Which activities broadly and how do they exacerbate climate change?

### The Climate is Changing Significantly More Than Usual

Is it important to note that the climate is always changing, it's just that recently the rate at which it is changing is significantly more.

It was first determined without doubt that the climate is changing significantly in 2007 with the "Fourth Assessment Report" by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
If you are not open minded, you should read the report. Otherwise, figure 1.3 from the [graphics](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg1/historical-overview-of-climate-change-science/) page should suffice.
Combining this graphic with one that gives us insight [to the past](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/climate-data-primer/past-climate) shows us that the climate has been changing significantly more (0.5° C)
in the last 50 years than previously.

I was quite disappointed by NASA's [climate evidence webpage](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/). Although it guided me in the right direction [IPCC Technical Summary](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_TS.pdf), it could've linked me to the Fourth Assessment Report themselves or shown the graphics with the methodology stated. I personally should not have to read the entire report to figure out if their methodology was
biased or lacking. I've already accepted that the climate is changing, but clearly if someone was skeptical, some graphs are not hard evidence. If scientists are trusting graphics without the methodology stated,
we simply cannot use the classic _ad populum_ fallacy of "99% of scientists believe in climate change." 99% of humans believed the Earth was the centre of the universe at one point too! 99% of humans in America believed woman were property at one point too. 99% of humans lived under monarchy at one point too. How sure are we that present day humans won't be outclassed in intelligence and morality by our decedents even 50 years down the line? I am certain I won't be outclassed, but am also certain 99% of humans living today will be outclassed by our decedents 100 years later. Not everyone is a Socrates, Aristotle, Archimedes, Galileo or the countless Sanskrit ancient text authors of our time.

### Human Activities

Of [Chapter 9 of the same AR4](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg1//), we see

> ... greenhouse gas forcing alone during the past half century would likely have resulted in greater than the observed warming if there had not been an offsetting cooling effect from aerosol and other forcings

> It is extremely unlikely (<5%) that the global pattern of warming during the past half century can be explained without external forcing, and very unlikely that it is due to known
>natural external causes alone. The warming occurred in both the ocean and the atmosphere and took place at a time when natural external forcing factors would likely have produced cooling

Essentially, the global cooling that is talked about would've continued had man not been emitting more greenhouse gasses.

## Why Should I Care About the Climate Changing?

A question that should be answered by every climate change activist but is abundantly assumed to be cared about. This isn't just about giving a reason, it's
about weighing the downsides.

Great now that we have determined that there is significant climate change and that is it anthropogenic influence.
It really doesn't matter if significant climate change is anthropogenic or not from a why perspective. It just makes it easier for us when we get to the solutions portion.
This question is the second hardest to answer, no doubt easier than solutions. So let's jump into it. There's a variety of answers here, so just stop once you find an issue that
you care about. I won't be putting in bullshit answers like "forest fires" when humans themselves are the cause of them. Forest fires aren't caused by climate change, humans are the cause of it.
If you want less forest fires, then we need to stop humans from starting camp fires! I also won't use natural disasters such as hurricanes because even without any climate change, they would still occur in vulnerable areas and the people living there would still not move!

- If you like seeing coral reefs, they are bleaching more now because of rising ocean temperatures
- The area you live in now is flooding more often because of the higher precipitation caused by increased temperatures. Yes you can move to an area that has opened up, so this is not that big of a deal. Humans have been moving for thousands of years which is why there's so many distinct ethnicity's. Humans moved in the past to survive better; changing our local environment to avoid moving is more and needlessly expensive. Poor people affected the most.
- Some species' are threatened because of loss of habitat due to climate change. I also think this is a cop out to refuse to confront poaching. I care about snow leopards but don't cop out climate change when they are endangered mainly because of poachers. Ban immoral poaching. If you want to poach an endangered species, make sure you breed the species so that you are the reason there's more of them not less of them.

Is climate change more important than your individual quality of life (e.g. escaping poverty). Morally speaking, no. I have no right to tell someone
of less financial fortune to stop consuming fossil fuels unless the alternative is cheaper, more efficient, or less environmentally polluting (nuclear!).
So while I do not have the right to _force_ someone to save the climate, I can definitely _force_ someone so that they escape poverty.

In short, there aren't many reasons to care about climate change if you live in an area with a predictable climate but I'd say that the coral reefs reason is good enough.

## Ill-Accounted Reasons

I'm not a climate change activist. I'm a neutral bystander who dislikes misleading information. Climate Change did not cause your forest fires. Reversing climate change is not going to stop hurricanes, floods, and tornados.
If floods never existed before climate change, how would the bible which was written by humans, even know of floods? They are called natural disasters for a reason, stop using these fictitious reasons to promote policies that benefit
some groups over others.

Pollution isn't a climate change issue. Burning coal has an effect on the climate as well as the environment. Dumping garbage on the ground effects the local environment, pollutes the water, but doesn't really have an affect ont the climate.

Droughts. They occur naturally and not only are droughts correlated with climate change or rising temperatures due to human CO2 emissions, they are correlated with population increase too. If you search up climate change and drought,
you'll get that for one of the droughts of many, only 46% was attributable to rising climate change. After searching "water consumption responsible for droughts" we see that "[around 1960 drought frequency was considerably enhanced by human water consumption](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034036#erl471582s4)." Therefore, droughts are not a climate change thing, but an anthropogenic non climate related unfortunate event. Fresh water should simply not be given away cheaply and to the largest consumers just because they can afford it. Every household should be allocated water consumption for 4 people before higher rates kick in. If you are a commercial business not related to food, then you should be paying higher rates. I'm looking at you golf courses. This also doesn't affect me, but it's easy to see how residents blame climate change and big oil for things their own behaviour (watering your lawn in the dessert) and the inefficient allocation of resources done by their municipality.

> It’s a double-edged sword too: worldwide, forest destruction – mainly for agriculture – is a major cause of climate change, generating an incredible amount of greenhouse gases.

[WWF](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/10-reasons-why-climate-change-important) wants to solve climate change so that the Amazon Rainforest won't be threatened, when it is already being cut down so that countries (Brazil) can increase agriculture to support their population. At some point, you'd think that they should advocate for a two child policy rather than blaming big oil. I think if your senseless breeding requires the Amazon Forest to be cut down, CO2 emissions isn't the problem, you are!

The WWF also believes that climate change increases food prices, and not say fertilizer costs or maybe the 8 billion people we need to food on a daily basis?

### Fictitious Reasons

A lot of people simply assume climate change is bad and when asked why they care about climate change, they use circular reasoning or non-convincing arguments such as "protecting the planet", "protecting ourselves", [I care about climate change because I have my kids](https://youtu.be/53n9wPYgI2g). The first person in that video even said it themselves; "first generation **to** feel the effects of climate change" as if we are yet to feel it! This is the problem with the climate change debate. Many people treat it like a boogeyman just like how people believe their astrological signs mean something. If we are feeling the effects of it currently, why talk as if you haven't felt it? I definitely have not felt the negative effects of it.

[Coffee fix](https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/10-reasons-why-climate-change-important)? Caffeine is a drug and like most drugs, humans are better off without their existence. You don't drink coffee because it keeps you awake, you drink it because you are addicted to it. Oh wine may be hit? Alcohol is worse than caffeine! If Caffeine and alcohol didn't exist or could not be produced, humans would be better off, not worse off.

## Solutions

### Managing Higher Urban Temperatures

One of the effects of climate change is higher temperatures. However, we do not need to combat climate change to combat higher temperatures. Cities are recording higher temperatures, but the media forgets that there's more humans in those cities every year. More humans in a city is going to end up being warmer regardless of an increase in greenhouse gases, more so if the population and infrastructure grows exponentially.

Stop using the darkest colors for roofs, cars, and roads. Those surfaces simply do not need to absorb so much heat. Black cars? Try red, blue, yellow, orange, white, hell even grey. I'll remember that
the first car I buy will be orange or red. We need more stamped asphalt so that walking looks more like a priority in comparison to driving.

### Brain Dump

This is a brain dump of my thoughts from months ago.

Problem: coral reefs

This isn't an all-convincing problem, but it convinced me a bit since although I have never seen corals face-to-face, the pictures are definitely beautiful.

https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/why-are-coral-reefs-dying
https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html

When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching.
When a coral bleaches, it is not dead.
Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.

New problem: Rising ocean temperatures

Rising ocean temperatures can be explained by an increase in absorbing the sun's energy.
This increase in absorbtion is because of an increase in green house gases which traps more energy from the sun.

New problem: green house gases

The problem isn't just stabalizing green house gases, but rather reducing it in general. Either by converting it to a more manageable form of matter (solid or liquid) or via a chemical reaction to another molecule. Another solution is to release the green house gases into space itself rather than contain it. So here are three options.

Simply stopping the burning of fossil fuels is not enough and I am 100% against signifiicant quality of life reduction for that. We need to ensure the right infrastructure is in place so that fossil fuels are simply not needed. We need fossil fuels for planes for example and plastics. These goods need to be replaced with alternatives well before banning fossil fuel burning. And do not forget, I said burning not exporting. Countries should not lower their citizens' quality of life by banning exports in order to virtue signal (a single countries emission reduction is not going to have any impact, they would have to also reduce greenhouse gases in general). One of the F1 drivers was trying to throw shade at Canada's oil as if exporting oil is worse than consuming it. Demand always comes before supply, it's not the demand for the product but rather demand for what the product is capable of offering. This is true for sex, drugs, and food.

Problem/Solution A: Naturally removing CO2 from the air

```txt
	SubProblem A.i: Forestry
	- Replacing wood with bamboos
	- https://www.guaduabamboo.com/blog/bamboo-is-a-highly-effective-carbon-sink
	- https://www.nature.com/articles/nindia.2021.46
	- maintaining wood reserves or replacing traditional trees with bamboos when they are cut down
	- toilet paper should be made from bamboos
	SubProblem A.ii: Roads
	- We need roads that can absorb CO2 from the air but can also handle heavy cars going over them. I don't think
	it is possible.
	Problem A.iii: Brazil / The Amazon
	- The amazon is being cut down for one reason and that is that Brazil's economy is not big enough for people to be well off; i.e. goods produced per person is not high enough. This can be solved by looking at how singapore and taiwan became rich.
	- we need people to invest in Brazil
	- we need people to produce portugese content, goods & services
