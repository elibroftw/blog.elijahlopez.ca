</h2><ul>
<li>What is the economy (i.e. output production. aka GDP)?
<ul>
<li>goods and services created that can we can place monetary value on
<ul>
<li>some activities may not be included like people staying at home instead of paying for daycare</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>output is made up by capital stock, labour and a productivity factor, which doesn&rsquo;t have numerical breakdown</li>
<li>there are many ways to measure GDP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Without impacting consumption, only productivity determines long-run economic growth
<ul>
<li>there are a variety of ways to improve productivity, read the section on policies <a href="#long-run-growth-policies">long-run-growth policies</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capital
<ul>
<li>Capital are assets that people use to generate output</li>
<li>Investments are made to maintain and grow capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Labour
<ul>
<li>People choose to make trade-offs between leisure and money</li>
<li>People want to fund their leisure time so work money for that purpose</li>
<li>Obviously and unfortunately, there are situations where the person is living to work versus working to live</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economic Cycle of busts and booms (&ldquo;full employment&rdquo;)
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;full employment&rdquo; is where unemployment rate equals natural unemployment, something hard to measure and can change</li>
<li>natural unemployment can exist due to matching issues (e.g. oil &amp; gas jobs went to renewable sector) and due to the <em>friction</em> of changing jobs (hunting for a job after being laid off)
<ul>
<li>Policies can be created to reduce matching issues and Employment Insurance can affect the friction (noticeable between provinces).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shocks are what change the state of the economy drastically
<ul>
<li>technology shocks (transistor, internet), productivity shocks (COVID-19), supply shocks (higher oil prices because of OPEC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Money
<ul>
<li>exists for the sole purpose of making commerce efficient</li>
<li>money can be interpreted as liquid assets meeting &ldquo;what can be used to buy goods right now&rdquo;</li>
<li>money supply is influenced by the central bank and is made large because of fractional reserve lending
<ul>
<li>for each dollar deposited at an institution, if the bank knows it only requires 20% to meet demand, it can lend until 80% has been fully lended (divide by 0.81)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inflation: increase in the price of goods and services
<ul>
<li>can be deliberately induced by the central bank
<ul>
<li>central bank policies have a lagging effect so money supply can grow in the past year and its effects may take another year</li>
<li>goal of money supply growth is to reduce interest rates to spur investments</li>
<li>money supply has no effects on full-employment in the long-term, short-term is up for debate since it does cause inflation</li>
<li>if the money supply grows, market participants end up realizing their dollars are worth less in a real sense and will increase prices</li>
<li>currently most central banks focus on annual inflation, but if they focused on stable price levels, then it would make it easier to properly invest today&rsquo;s money. Inflation targeting results in $1 being equal to a range of values in 20 years rather than a single value, which would be the case if price level targeting was used instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>inducement by federal
<ul>
<li>crowding out: interest rates go up (lower private investments) because federal government spending too much</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>costs of inflation
<ul>
<li>cost of updating price labels:  <em>shoe leather costs</em></li>
<li>unanticipated inflation hurts savers and rewards banks and lenders</li>
<li>hyperinflation: money loses meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unexpected inflation and unemployment are related
<ul>
<li>almost impossible to keep inflation unexpected</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Flow variables: measure per unit of time (e.g. annual GDP)</li>
<li>Stock variables: one point in time (e.g. amount of money in your bank account on December 20th)</li>
<li>flow is equal to the rate of change of the stock</li>
<li>National Wealth = domestic physical assets + net foreign assets</li>
<li>net foreign assets: foreign stocks, bonds, and factories owned by domestic residents minus foreign liabilities (domestic assets owned by foreigners)</li>
<li>National wealth can change due to the values changing, or national saving dollar for dollar</li>
<li>Therefore, national saving can be used to increase stock of domestic physical capital (I) and increase foreign assets</li>

<p>Productivity and standard of living is highly correlated, but is it a casual relationship? I don&rsquo;t think so.

<li>Since capital stock is long lived and investments only have a significant effect slowly, it is often fixed by economists when analyzing a few years</li>
<li>year-to-year changes can often be traced to changes in employment</li>
<li>assumptions
<ul>
<li>workers are all alike (ignore aptitude, skills, ambition, etc. ) (why though? I feel that ambition &amp; skills are very important, such as minimum wage jobs and non-minimum wage jobs)</li>
<li>firms decide how many to employ, not at what wage to employ, that&rsquo;s determined by competition</li>
<li>firms hire based on maximizing profit (true but some company&rsquo;s are hiring for growth and then doing mass layoffs)
<ul>
<li>the benefit of the extra worker exceeds their cost</li>
<li>when the marginal product of labour (MPN) equals the real wage (in units of output)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marginal Revenue Product of Labour (MRPN), measure extra revenue produced for adding another worker = Price times MPN
<ul>
<li>MRPN = MPN * price = nominal wage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can also state that the real wage is determined by the output, so then we can state when MPN increases, increased employment / real wage increase
<ul>
<li>the real wage is cost to employ (nominal wage) divided by selling price per unit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The labour demand curve is relationship of the workers demanded and the real wage the firm faces (equal to MPN curve)
<ul>
<li>N doesn&rsquo;t have to be workers per se, could be hours</li>
<li>It shifts due to supply shocks. Positive shocks increases MPN (and thus employment).</li>
<li>Reducing payroll taxes would be a supply shock
<ul>
<li>Reducing sales tax is not a supply shock. That&rsquo;s a goods demanded shock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, an increase in capital stock also increases MPN</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aggregate Labour Demand
<ul>
<li>demand for labour of all firms in the economy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Labour hoarding
<ul>
<li>During a recession, hiring and firing costs are too much to otherwise layoff</li>

<li>Each person decides whether to work or to do non-work actions (<strong>leisure</strong>)
<ul>
<li>We want to give as many people possible the right to not work and not get paid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A person who wants to make themselves as well off as possible, would work as much such that each hour worked makes up for each hour of free time given up</li>
<li>Therefore, real wage = amount of real income that a worker receives in exchange for giving up a unit of leisure</li>
<li>Substitution effect of a higher real wage: workers supply more labour in response to a higher reward</li>
<li>Pure income effect
<ul>
<li>when a worker&rsquo;s wealth increases, the income is less valuable, therefore more time is spent on leisure</li>
<li>when future wages will increase, there is an implied increase in wealth, therefore more time is spent on leisure</li>
<li>long-term increase in real wage: both effects
<ul>
<li>temporary no income effect since workers want to take advantage</li>
<li>permanent we see income effect (aggregate supply of labour goes down)</li>
<li>size of effect is dependent on each person&rsquo;s situation include tax rates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suppose tax percent has increased just for the current year
<ul>
<li>less likely to work since the time spent working is definitely less than letting go off leisure and since it&rsquo;s only one year,
the loss of income for one year isn&rsquo;t convincing enough</li>

<li>suppose there is a lump-sum tax (value not percentage)

<li>income effect only, so have to work more</li>

<li>Labour Supply Curve
<ul>
<li>quantity of labour supplied for the real wage</li>
<li>shifts right if economy-wide real-wage rises</li>
<li>Increase in wealth increases amount of leisure workers can afford (curve shifts left)</li>
<li>Increases in expected future real wages increases amount of leisure workers can afford</li>
<li>Increase in working age population increases number of workers (curve shifts right)</li>
<li>An increase in the participation rate increases number of workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equilibrium
<ul>
<li>Classical model implies quick real wage adjustments
<ul>
<li>Assumption is that people would be able to find jobs very quickly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At equilibrium workers get a wage that just about equals the compensation for surrendering leisure</li>
<li>When neither side is satisfied, something will have to give to get to Equilibrium
<ul>
<li>When many workers are competing for few jobs, real wage falls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>full-employment level (N with line on top) at market-clearing real wage (w with line on top)</li>
<li>have no accounted for unemployment yet</li>
<li>A negative supply shock would decrease demand for labour (which equals MPN) at every level of employment so we could get lower wages
<ul>
<li>there is a decrease in demand for labour because the expenditure for non-labour factors are higher and thus there is a lower optimal level</li>
<li>Temporary, so labour supply curve does not shift</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Since more firms in Canada use petroleum as an input in the production process than produce oil as an output, increases in energy prices have generally been viewed as an adverse supply shock for the Canadian economy as a whole. Canadian firms have become more energy efficient due to these shocks.</p>

<li>Full Employment Output (Y with line on top)  = A F(K, N (with line on top))</li>
<li>Education levels do not affect the labour market since the students are not part of the workforce and thus MPN has not actually increased (yet?)</li>
<li>Things like energy supplies are other factors of production that can definitely impact the labour market (higher costs means higher MPN required)</li>

<li>My guess is that Canada&rsquo;s natural rate of unemployment is between 5.5% - 5.6% because it was around this in 2019 and was below this during the inflation that occurred during 2022. When rates started going up, so did unemployment and now we are at 5.8% which I believe is still above natural unemployment due to the higher numbers of international students and the hours they can work.</li>

- cars don't last as long as houses and require financing (interests)
- houses are 10x car prices and have amortization period of 20+ years so higher interest rates means paying more in interest + you need to pay maintenance
- some people are
- interest payments on student loans (not applicable anymore due to federal laws allowing tax deduction)
- the situation where real interest rates rise seems like during periods of high inflation &rarr; less inflation so maybe people had to reduce consumption and the temporary higher real interest rates just allows for returning to normal spending habits
- when real interest rates rise, what are expectations for the stock market? If they are the same, then why would people save more? how many people are actually saving?

<p>Is Japan high post flattening of GDP or was it always high?</p>
<p>Two opposing forces: purchase or construction of new capital goods  (<strong>gross investment</strong>)increases capital stock but capital stock does depreciate and wear out which reduces the capital stock. I feel that with software, tech debt does not actually wear until it becomes unbearable and unproductive to use and/or update.
The difference between gross investment and depreciation is <strong>net investment</strong>.</p>
<p>net investment = gross investment - depreciation</p>

<p>Suppose that nominal money supply growth is 10% per year, real income is growing by 3% per year, and the income elasticity of money demand is 2/3. Then, Eq. (7.12) predicts that the inflation rate will be 10% − (2/3)(3%), or 8% per year.</p>

<li>Transactions where the good being purchased was not currently produced won&rsquo;t be included in the current account. Trade of existing assets is recorded in the capital and financial account.

<p>A severe recession is called a depression. Sequence from one peak to the next is called the business cycle. Properties include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fluctuations of aggregate economic activity</li>
<li>Feature expansions and contractions</li>
<li>Persistent</li>

<p>History shows that business cycles have become less severe, attributed somewhat to better monetary policies, but it could simply be better measurements, more job variability, or a lot of things. There&rsquo;s no proof that all these factors will always be there, especially when some countries are not appealing to live in (e.g. UK).</p>

<p>What is not consistent is that the real interest rate might not increase due to mismatched expectations; apparently if the shock is expected to be permanent, rates would not rise; the lesson says the shock was temporary, but historic oil prices shows that the oil prices stayed steady after 1974 till the next shock, whereas oil prices decreased after 1980. Real interest rates only rise if the expectation is that it is temporary.</p>
<p>1973-1974 Oil shock: USA gave $2.2B to Israel and OAPEC (OPEC Arab countries) decided to have an oil embargo on the USA. It is pretty clear that people would think this shock would be permanent. It&rsquo;s not really clear why oil prices remained high even after the embargo ended in 1974. Prices most likely remained the same due to the devaluation of the USD by that time.</p>

</h3><p>An increase in domestic money supply shifts the LM down, causing the domestic interest rate to fall below the foreign rate. Arbitrage opportunities induce capital flow into foreign from domestic, depreciating the domestic currency. A depreciated currency makes net exports cheaper, shifting the IS curve to teh right. The end result, assuming a fixed price-level, is an equal interest rate, depreciated currency, and higher net exports.</p>

</h3><p>The nominal exchange rate is official set by the government, possibly in agreement with other countries. If the fundamental rate, determined by free market participants is less than the official rate, then the currency is overvalued. Responses include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The country can devalue the currency (by reducing the exchange rate) but if it did this a lot, it might as well employ a flexible-rate system.</li>
<li>The country could also restrict international transactions to reduce the supply of its currency to the foreign exchange market, thus raising the fundamental value; even though this is suppression.</li>
<li>Country could purchase its own currency via the central banks official reserve assets (gold, foreign bank deposits, and special assets created by agencies like the IMF). Reserve assets = balance of payments deficit. This method has its limits since some countries ran out of gold and thus a currency devaluation was inevitable.</li>

</h3><p>A producer&rsquo;s wage is equal to the price of the good being produced. Price and output is related (higher the price more goods are produced and vice versa). The producer has to use previous expectations of the current price level to estimate the actual price level. So if there is an expectation of 5% inflation and price of bread increases by 5%, then baker retains output since the real wage has not changed. Therefore, the change in output can simply be due to the difference between the general and expected price levels.</p>
<img class=equation src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Y=Y\bar+b(P-P^e)" alt="Y=Y\bar+b(P-P^e)">
<p>We see here that supply can be higher if the actual price level is higher than the expected price level. This is because suppliers will think the a portion of the actual prices is real and will increase output to capture the difference.</p>
<p>So although Long-Run Aggregate Supply is vertical, Short Run Aggregate Supply is a curve swinging upwards intersecting when P = Pe. Anticipated monetary policy has no effects.</p>

<p>For an increase in money supply, there are two price level adjustments since one occurs before labour contracts are renegotiated</p>
<p>In the Classical model in the previous chapter, anticipated or unanticipated government spending influences wealth and the full employment output, whereas in the Keynesian model, participants anticipate the effects of the fiscal policy and negotiate a wage that would maintain the real wage (no change in wealth). With an unanticipated fiscal policy,</p>
<p>Fiscal and monetary policies are both referred to as aggregate demand policies because both policies affect the position of the aggregate demand curve. Only unanticipated fiscal policies have a long-term affect.</p>

</h3><p>Recessions are undesirable because the unemployed are hurt. Government policies can quickly restore to general equilibrium but would increase price level in the long-run tha if no action was taken. In my opinion, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a need to fear people being unemployed if people could get a reduction in their tax bills equal to their estimated savings. Someone with $0 in savings should not have to pay as much in taxes nor should they get less in EI than someone who has $100,000 in savings. The latter can still maintain their assets so if anything EI should be as normalized as possible across the board. Secondly, there should not be a labour surplus during non-booming times. The government can also fund education during times of recessions so that people out of job can still get educated for skilled jobs that have labour shortages (grants given for specific programs).</p>

</h3><p>Monetarism relies on the assumption that the government and the central bank are incompetent and can&rsquo;t intervene effectively. The argument against rules is that the central bank has done better post world war II; in other words, monetary policy is getting better. However, the rules argument is not just about incompetence but also about credibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose the central bank says they will maintain a stable money supply. If there is no credibility, firms can increase prices because they know the central bank will increase money supply. If there is credibility, firms will realize prices would come down anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p>To increase credibility, the central bank has to be willing to let the economy go into a recession if firms doubt the central bank and try messing with short-term output.</p>
<p>Ironclad rules create risks when prevent corrective actions from taking place during unexpected crisis&rsquo; (e.g. depression).</p>

<p>Described actual behaviour of U.S. Federal Reserve quite accurately. Meant as a guideline. A number of countries have adopted inflation targeting since the 90s. An advantage is that it&rsquo;s simple to understand so households can make decisions. A major disadvantage is that inflation responds to policy with a long lag so the bank has to act 12-18 months early.</p>

</h3><p>Bank of Canada is exploring targeting price level because it provides certainty about long-term purchasing power of money. With inflation targeting being a band of 1-3% per year, investors have to plan for cumulative inflation of 28% to 109% in 25 years. With price-level targeting, the price level fo 164.06 is certain, but the central bank must allow inflation to be variable. If year one has 1% inflation, under inflation targeting, only 2% needs to be hit in the next. Under price-level targeting, a price level of 104.04 is sought and an inflation rate of 3% is tolerable.</p>
<p>Price level targeting allows greater flexibility. If interest rates are raised to cool housing and inflation falls, there is still commitment that the long-term price-level will remain.</p>
<p>The decision to use Price-Level targeting all comes down to the public&rsquo;s ability to plan and look ahead.</p>

<p>Revenue comes from direct and indirect taxes.</p>
<p>Revenue comes from direct (imposed on taxpayer such as personal income taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes such as EI and CPP/QPP) and indirect taxes (25%) where the burden imposed on an entity is passed to another entity (e.g. sales tax, GST, HST).</p>
<p>Budget break down:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good and Services: 1/4 of federal spending and 3/4 for other levels</li>
<li>Transfer Payments: Greater proportion in federal than lower tiers</li>
<li>Interest Payments: more important in federal but proportion wise lower-tier pay more</li>
</ol>
<p>Reminder that surplus = Tax Revenue (T) minus Government purchases (G) minus Transfers (TR) minus interest payments (INT)</p>
<p>The <strong>primary budget surplus</strong> excludes interest payments. The importance of this concept is to answer the question on if the government can afford its current programs.</p>

<li>My solution: federal government should not be directly transferring to individuals but only to provinces.

</h3><p>Assumption is that the same people paying taxes today will be responsible for paying back the debt that the government accumulated during their life. The argument that the equivalence would hold is that the current generation would save out of the goodness of their hearts to help the next generation BUT it will still appear unfair either in the sense that the next generation earns less and pays more in taxes and thus is looked down upon by the current generation as being too stupid to earn more.</p>
<p>Reasons it may fail:</p>
<ol>
<li>borrowing constraints: many people would consume more if lenders existed</li>
<li>shortsightedness: people don&rsquo;t get that they will pay for the government&rsquo;s debt</li>

<li>small differences in growth rates lead to large differences in the average person&rsquo;s income</li>
<li>since 1973, industrialized countries experienced a sustained slowdown; significant slowdown of productivity growth
<ul>
<li>argument one: no slowdown bu measurement error (failing to measure improved quality of capital inputs - like computers)
<ul>
<li>my take: probably this since desktops came in 1970s and they only got cheaper and better over time. It&rsquo;s easy to fail to adjust the value of today&rsquo;s computers and electronics to as high as they used to be. Especially as price data is lost and competition is rife. Old technology was measured so high but it&rsquo;s output would be worth $0 today</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>argument two: large increase in oil prices since the timing and universal effect is there but productivity did not surge back up after oil prices came down
<ul>
<li>this did reduce productivity, obviously but by the time prices went up, computers started taking over</li>

<ul>
<li>A) decrease its holding of net foreign assets.</li>
<li>B) run a capital account deficit in 2004.</li>
<li>C) run a balance of payments surplus.</li>
<li>D) decrease its official reserve assets.</li>

<li>D) The world as a whole has a current account surplus.</li>

<p>The world has a current account deficit</p>
<p>This is because a current account deficit equals capital account surplus. Therefore, it follows that there is a higher deficit due to this mechanism rather than the offsetting current account surpluses in other countries.</p>
<p>If there is an increase in the future marginal product of capital in a large open economy, it causes the
current account to <code>________</code> and saving to <code>________</code>.</p>

<li>B) fall; rise</li>
<li>C) rise; rise</li>
<li>D) rise; remain unchanged</li>

<p>If future marginal product of capital increases, then current investments increase, which can borrow locally or at the world rate (current account falls). The higher rates entices saving.</p>
<p>Absorption: amount consumed by domestic residents</p>
<p>When a temporary adverse supply shock hits a small open economy, it causes the current account to
<code>________</code> and investment to <code>________</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A) fall; remain unchanged</li>
<li>B) fall; fall</li>
<li>C) rise; remain unchanged</li>
