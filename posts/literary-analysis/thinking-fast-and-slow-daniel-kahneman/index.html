</h2><p>A book about biases of intuition and how to create diagnoses and labels just like doctors have/do for illnesses.</p>
<p>Amos Tversky was one of the first in decision making research. Kahneman asked him in 1959 to speak at a seminar</p>
<p>A question was proposed. Whether humans are intuitive statisticians just like we are intuitive grammarians. The question lead to a survey proposal to figure out if researchers collect too few observations than necessary to draw conclusions, which lead to the conclusion that statisticians themselves are not intuitive and are not able to properly state how likely a result is to reproduce in a smaller sample. The goal was to judge the intuitive answers and not the actual answers to the statistical questions.</p>

</h3><p>We can describe Steve as a person who resembles the &ldquo;stereotypical&rdquo; librarian and ask if Steve is more likely to be a librarian or a farmer. Most people choose librarian even though the ratio of male farmers to male librarians are 20:1. Personally, I did not fall for this trick because the stereotype that librarians are shy is not true, they are very outgoing and are the first to say hello to you.</p>

</h3><p>The previous study highlights the resemblance rule of thumb that people make use of when asked with a difficult problem which leads to predictable biases. The takeaway here is to be aware of when we are employing this heuristic as to not make important decisions from them.</p>

</h3><p>Two questions. One is questioning rate of divorce among professors which triggers searching for people trying to recall whether they know of such a situation. A more formal question is &ldquo;Is the letter K more likely to appear in words of a text at the start or at the third position.&rdquo; I personally think the third position as I could only think of a handful of words that start with K that are used often versus the word &ldquo;like&rdquo; which is even in the sentence! As I read further on, I am vindicated. I&rsquo;m happy the book has been rubbing off on me.</p>
<p>The bias of the answers is that people are mostly thinking of words starting with the letter K than when K is in third position, so they will exaggerate the frequency of K being in the first position.</p>

</h3><p>When information pertaining to one situation is shown/presented more often than information pertaining to another, it is easy to place a higher probability on the former situation. The example in the book is that the author challenged his long-standing impression that politicians cheated more often than physicians and lawyers but it turned out his impression was just that and could be due to the choices of journalists. This is a very good topic that Noam Chomsky talks about in his books Manufacturing Consent, Media Control.</p>
<p>This heuristic also applies to what issues the public is vocal about and silent about. For example, vocal about housing crisis, not vocal about male circumcision.</p>

</h3><p>A remarkable feat of intuition, a fire fighter commander yelled to people to get out after they put out a kitchen fire as his ears were hot and fire was quiet so he could tell something was wrong. The floor collapsed soon after the fire fighters got out.</p>
<p>After studying chess master, Herbert Simon determined that the master saw the pieces differently after hours of practice since they could draw on information stored in memory rather than having to think and ponder over a position.</p>
<p>The parallel is drawn to how we are not surprised when a two-year old points to a dog with glee and says &ldquo;doggie!.&rdquo;</p>

</h3><p>There is a stark difference between someone making a decision based on hours of experience and the example in the textbook of a chief investment officer buying shares in Ford because he was impressed at an automobile show he attended. A gut feeling is not the same as expert intuition, although a gut feeling that can be explained via hard facts like &ldquo;hot ear&rdquo; is different than the gut feeling based on feelings.</p>
<p>Conclusion by the author is that emotion plays a big role in intuition and the stock picker is an example of the Affect Heuristic; guided by feelings of like and dislike with little to no reasoning/deliberation.</p>

</h2><p>Highlighted difference between how easy it was to identify a woman&rsquo;s mood based on a glance of the image versus a multiplication problem 17 x 24, which most people are not tuned to answer using intuitive thinking. When doing the problem mentally, we keep the intermediate results in our brain, while our body is strained, and our eys focused. The answer of 408 finally comes after some time.</p>
<p>System 1: operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control</p>
<p>System 2: allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.</p>
<details><summary>Some examples of System 1 are provided</summary>
<ul>
<li>Detect that one object is more distant than another.</li>
<li>Orient to the source of a sudden sound.</li>
<li>Complete the phrase “bread and…”</li>
<li>Make a “disgust face” when shown a horrible picture.</li>
<li>Detect hostility in a voice.</li>
<li>Answer to 2 + 2 = ?</li>
<li>Read words on large billboards.</li>
<li>Drive a car on an empty road.</li>
<li>Find a strong move in chess (if you are a chess master).</li>
<li>Understand simple sentences.</li>
<li>Recognize that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail” resembles an occupational stereotype.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary>System 2 operations share a common feature of attention and being disrupted when attention is drawn away</summary>
<ul>
<li>Brace for the starter gun in a race</li>
<li>Focus attention on the clowns in the circus</li>
<li>Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room</li>
<li>Look for a woman with white hair</li>
<li>Search memory to identify a surprising sound</li>
<li>Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you</li>
<li>Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation</li>
<li>Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text.</li>
<li>Tell someone your phone number</li>
<li>Park in a narrow space (for most people except garage attendants)</li>
<li>Compare two washing machines for overall value.</li>
<li>Fill out a tax form</li>
<li>Check the validity of a complex logical argument</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Performance of system 2 thinking falters when attention is taken away. Therefore, multi-tasking can only really work when there are no System 2 tasks involved.</p>
<p>Another takeaway is that when driving in an area that is of higher stress, a passenger can easily lower the performance of the driver. Example of the video of the invisible gorilla was given, where the conclusion is that not only can we be blind to what we ought to have seen, we are also blind to the fact that we are blind.</p>
<p>System 1 is running automatically, and system 2 is in low-effort mode. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. System 2 endorses the directive of system 1, these into beliefs or voluntary actions with little modifications. Whereas if System 1 fails, it calls on System 2. System 1 is basically surprised by an event that it determines not to fit in its model. System 2 is also used for continuous monitoring (e.g. polite when angry), and mobilizes when an error is about to occur. The &ldquo;division of labour&rdquo; between these systems leads to minimizing effort and maximizing performance. System 1 has biases though and the system cannot be turned off.</p>

</h3><p>The previous section I read was very good as it made me think of architecture designs when it comes to autonomous artificial intelligence as well as computer chips.</p>
<p>When designing an autonomous agent, we probably want it to also have these two systems. We might want to develop two different networks, somewhat connected, where the first network takes in input and tries to quickly generate something, which is then fed into a second system specialized in correctness, and then a third system depending on if the second system took displeasure.</p>
<p>When designing a chip, since most tasks are system 1 thinking, we want to pack as many efficient cores as possible that focus on minimizing energy usage and maximizing common tasks. For example, a computer is going to be used for two tasks most of the time: browsing the internet (network I/O), some sort of app that makes uses storage (productivity apps). Of course, a computer can also be designed knowing it will be used for a niche tasks more often than the others (e.g. gaming CPUs). So when mass producing these CPUs, 80% will be E cores, while maybe 20% will be performance. The 80-20 rule comes in handy a lot, but it too is a bias.</p>
<p>Obviously, we need to also determine what is the ideal number of cores and that comes down to total ideal energy usage as well as costs. Industry standard is 8 cores for mobile max, but I think 10 cores would be a game changer as two more E-cores can be added while maintaining 2 P-cores.</p>

</h3><p>This section starts by highlighting the difference in our efficiency when we are told to do a task where the contents the task pertains to have related or opposite meaning. The example tasks was read a column of words and whispering the casing of the words. The efficiency is lower when the words themselves are the words that could bew whispered. So when reading upper, you whisper lower, and when reading LOWER you whisper upper. Conclusion: system 2 is in charge of self control.</p>

<p>The horizontal lines are in fact equal but you should&rsquo;ve seen this illusion or some form of it enough time by the time you are 22 years old.</p>
<p>Even though we know that the lengths are equal, we still see that the bottom is longer, and this is system 1 at work. Although we can teach ourselves to ignore line length comparison when fins are attached, we cannot override system 1 thinking, for some reason.</p>
<p>It does seem that AI can be fed a lot of system 2 thinking without hindering what I call the system 1 thinking. So our own perception of what system 1 cannot overcome, can definitely be overcome by AI in a similar response time.</p>
<p>Cognitive Illusions. Apparently the professor of psychology at one of the lectures the author attended said therapists will meet a patient who claims this time will be different and how previous therapists have failed him and the professor says this person is most likely a psychopath so to skip them; Psychopathic charm. I don&rsquo;t get it though. As a therapist, can&rsquo;t you just use a psychopath for research then? Do moral psychopaths not exist? Plus you get paid anyways. Also some patients probably are hard on themselves and exaggerate the inefficacy of therapists.</p>
<p>Avoiding tedious effort, we should aim to learn to recognize when mistakes are more likely to be made and avoid significant mistakes in serious situations, as I mentioned earlier.</p>

</h3><p>A dilated pupil can be interpreted as someone being interested. Whether in what they are looking at or in glee for the information they have processed. Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort. There is distinction between dilated pupils from mental effort and emotional effort. My girlfriend definitely recalled once when I was programming during a video call with her.</p>
<p>Jackson Beatty and Kahneman decided to do a test where participants would be asked questions and they would answer while pictures of their eye would be taken using an infrared camera on every beat of a metronome. The task of Add-1 was given where participants would speak each digit one by one, allowing the cameras to capture correlations of dilation with respect to many factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add-1 with four digits caused a larger dilation than the task of holding seven digits for immediate recall. Add-3, which is much more difficult, is the most demanding that I ever observed. In the first 5 seconds, the pupil dilates by about 50% of its original area and heart rate increases by about 7 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When tasks become much harder, the pupils shrank or stop dilating. Therefore maximum dilation also means maximum tolerable difficulty, which if breached will lead to giving up.</p>
<p>After witnessing the pupils under a mundane conversation, where the pupils did not dilate, the conclusion drawn was that System 2 usually works at &ldquo;the pace of a comfortable walk&rdquo; and is sometimes interrupted by jogs/sprints. Priority to other tasks decreases as mental energy increases and so blindness also is coincident with mental strain.</p>

</h3><p>As people are more skilled at tasks, less energy is require and this is a symptom of laziness being built into us. Effort is a cost so if we want to lower it, we acquire skills.</p>

<p>Time pressure makes the mind work uncomfortably hard.</p>
<p>We avoid mental overloading by committing intermediate memory into long-term memory or paper rather than overloading the working memory. Therefore, one might say to get better at writing/typing, but we can take it a step further that we can study the biological ways to expand the working memory as well as determining at what point a CPU cache is too big.</p>

</h3><p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi studied the state of effortless attending, <em>flow</em>. Concentration so deep that you lose sense of time. I have attained this flow myself several times. The last time where I achieved flow was a week ago. It was Friday and I was working. Three hours or more went by just like that. A recent but more memorable example is the C# console application template I made. The purpose of the project is irrelevant, but it was definitely something that required no self-control and one that did require me expending energy. I was unable to simply pause the project, I was determined to make it work just the way I wanted it to work before I went to sleep. When there is no effort required in self-control, resources are free to be expensed on the task at hand. The question I have is did the task muster the flow or is flow a perk of some sort that improves the performance at the task?</p>

<p>Disturbing consequences: It was found that for parole judges in Israel, although the default decision is denial, with 35% approval rating, the proportion spikes after each meal, when about 65% of requests are granted. The approval rating drops to zero just before the next meal. What can we do? The default should be approval, and the judges have to write reasons to disapprove. Of course that means more criminals are on parole, but the point of the justice system is rehabilitation and reintegration, not punishment.</p>

When we answer the question with 10 cents, our system 2 would rather approve system 1 thinking that invest the small effort in double checking the answer. At renowned universities (Harvard, MIT, Princeton), 50+ % of students gave the wrong answers however at all the other universities, it was in 80+ %. The law of least effort is at work and many do not have active minds?</p>
<p>In Grade 12 philosophy, we did some exercises on logic. In this book we are asked to determine if this argument is sound as fast as possible</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>All roses are flowers.</li>
<li>Some flowers fade quickly.</li>
<li>Therefore some roses fade quickly.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I determined it was wrong because I re-read the first sentence to ensure I interpreted it properly. When I first read this, I made the relationship that flowers are the subset of roses, but when reading the third statement, I re-read the first statement to ensure that it wasn&rsquo;t the other way around and it was the other way around so I knew the argument was not sound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This experiment has discouraging implications for reasoning in everyday life. It suggests that when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow</p>

<p>I wonder if this premise follows the conclusion reasoning can be applied elsewhere. <strong>*cough* *cough*</strong>.</p>
<p>A funny question asked was to guess the number of murders in Michigan which resulted in lower guesses than people asked about murders in Detroit, because people do not think about Detroit when they are told about Michigan.

</h3><p>When we encounter words (or ideas), we are primed to think of the related ideas when faced with the next input. For example I&rsquo;m hungry. What letter goes here: SO_P? Did you say SOUP? What if I said I plan on going to shower soon. Maybe SOAP? Khaneman says that the initial idea/word of EAT or WASH primes us to prefer one mental path over another. Psychological research pertaining to mapping these ripples is an exciting pursuit.</p>
<p>There is more to priming than concepts and words. Actions and emotion can be primed by events that you are unaware of.</p>
<p>In the Florida effect study done by John Bargh, students were asked to come up with sentences from a set of five words and the students who assembled sentences related to the elderly {Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle}  walked slower in the task of being told to walk to another room.</p>
<p>The ideomotor effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;none of the students reported noticing that the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words they had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reciprocal priming also exists where walking slow leads to recognizing words related to old age!</p>
<p>In the book there is an interesting example of how people can be made to smile subconsciously by telling them to put a pencil in their teeth so that the eraser is facing the left and the point faces the right. This smiling is also associated with finding things funnier although the participant would not notice.</p>
<p>Habitual connections is all it takes. Heading nodding up and down can translate to being more agreeable. This applies even to voting when a vote occurring in a school makes voters partial towards school motions as well as if images are shown. Images have a greater effect than being a parent versus a non-parent.</p>
<p>We can even prime people to be money-primed and the effect will be significant enough to be noticeable. From being more selfish to prefer being more independent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*cough* *cough*</p>
<p>Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and we have no conscious access to them, even if these priming examples lead to percents in changes.</p>
<p>A funny example of priming is an honesty box where there was a banner close by with either eyes or flowers and the money given per litre of milk consumed moved significantly. It goes to show you that we can make people behave more ethical not be actually violating people&rsquo;s privacy, but my priming them with the idea that they are not in the clear to act unethically.</p>
<p>We can apparently prime people to be critical, so this can even translate into software development where people review PRs. We could possibly prime the reviewer by tinkering with the review interface.</p>

<p>When people were asked how much they would contribute to help out birds that would otherwise drown, the number of birds to help didn&rsquo;t matter because the groups still averaged the same amount of money. &ldquo;The almost complete neglect of quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times.&rdquo; Is it the neglect of emotional contexts, or does emotional contexts translate to a price for people and people would still answer with the max amount of money?</p>
<p>The mental shotgun is the inability of system 2 to direct system 1 to one train of thoughts. System 1 will always do more than just what is required of it. An example is asking someone who hates big tech if the companies in big tech are financially well off. Or better yet, asking someone who likes a product if the company is doing well (when the company is not in fact doing well such as Peloton).</p>

<details><summary>What is the meaning of happiness?</summary>
<p>The equivalent heuristic is &ldquo;what makes me happy right now&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meaning of happiness is two-parts. The first part is of positive events and milestones. The second part is the minimization of being harmed, whether that be emotionally, physically, or even physiologically (e.g. shelter, food, people).</p>
</details>
<p>For &ldquo;How&rdquo; types of questions, intensity matching is the process of converting the answer of a heuristic into an answer for the original question. If both things have a scale, then we can easily translate in our heads using System 1.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thinking-fast-and-slow/three-men.webp" alt="Three men in a corridor"></p>
<details><summary>Is the figure on the right larger than the figure on the left?</summary>
<p>This is a powerful illusion. There is no larger man. The 3D interpretation screws with our heads. We are tricked because we are thinking about the actual size of the people and not of the drawing. The bias is very deep, although the figure on the right is drawn in a peculiar manner.</p>
</details>
<p>Going back to the happiness question when asked about happiness and more, the order matters. If a question that could be a heuristic for happiness is asked first, it severely influences the happiness question. The example is asking about dating life and then happiness.</p>

</h2><p>The title of this chapter is a play on words. The law of large numbers does not actually apply to small numbers, although intuitions believe so!</p>
<p>Why are the counties with the lowest and highest rates of kidney cancer rural? Rural life can&rsquo;t explain both but being presented with one of these will make you use the rural life as an explanation of the statistic.</p>
<p>These are statistical facts so the actual possibility could simply be that there isn&rsquo;t enough of a sample size to draw a solid conclusion. When population is smaller, the variability of any observation rate is high and cannot be taken as mere forward thinking fact. Ergo randomness.</p>
<p>The explanation can be done with marbles. Imagine there&rsquo;s a pool of marbles of two different colours and two people sampling different sizes. The person sampling a smaller size is more likely to hit a homogenous sample than the person drawing more marbles. So if red marbles are kidney cancer and white marbles are not kidney cancer, then the person drawing smaller samples (for each county) is going to be hitting both all no cancers and all cancers.</p>
<p>Artifacts: results entirely produced by the method of research</p>
<blockquote>
<p>psychologists commonly chose samples so small that they exposed themselves to a 50% risk of failing to confirm their true hypotheses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this even though a sample size can be computed from the acceptable risk of failure.</p>
<p>Then when we discuss polls, people are not sensitive to the sample size!</p>
<p>There is a general bias that favour certainty over doubt which requires the hard work of sustaining doubt.</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation invested money to find out the characteristics of the most successful schools. One of the conclusions of this research is that the most successful schools, on average, are small. In a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania, for instance, 6 of the top 50 were small, which is an over-representation by a factor of 4..</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this finding based on what we discussed at the start of the chapter?</p>
<p>The first thing that came to my mind due to what was mentioned earlier was that the schools were small because of the inherent variability in smaller schools similar to rural counties. I&rsquo;m surprised the book thinks that the readers have not learned how to recognize the bias yet. It turns out that even the worst schools were smaller so all these foundations investing in smaller schools might have backfired.</p>
<p>Takeaways of the chapter</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easy to pay more attention to the result than the reliability of the data used</li>
<li>how certain are we the results are not chance?</li>
<li>when drawing conclusions of good, we should also look at the conclusion of bad. To do good is also to avoid doing bad. (I added this)</li>

<p><em>affect heuristic</em>: using how do I feel about it to answer what to think about it.</p>
<p>This heuristic makes the world seem more ordered than it is in reality. When people hear about benefits, they automatically think there is less risk (vice versa as well). In the real world, trade-offs do exist.</p>
<p>According to Paul Slovic, evaluation of risk depends on the measure itself (death per million, death per millions of dollars of product produced). “defining risk is thus an exercise in power.”</p>
<p>Cass Sunstein takes another stance which is that the existing USA regulations are about public perception and not rationality. He argues that we should focus on saving life-years, not even just life. By looking at life-years, we would focus on younger people more. Insert: this was a very important distinction, as I viewed adults and children as equal life before I read this. I still dislike when media, including government statements always include that women are affected even when men are affected more (e.g. homelessness in Canada).</p>

<p>On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried.

</h2><p>Fictitious person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Linda is a teacher in elementary school.</li>
<li>Linda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes.</li>
<li>Linda is active in the feminist movement.</li>
<li>Linda is a psychiatric social worker.</li>
<li>Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
<li>Linda is an insurance salesperson.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Sets up a contradiction to the intuition that Linda is part of the feminist and a bank teller compared to just being a bank teller. “feminist bank teller” ranked higher than “bank teller” in both. Representativeness wins against logic even when asking Statistics doctoral students.</p>
<p>Problem was shortened to just &ldquo;bank teller&rdquo; versus &ldquo;bank teller and active in the feminist movement&rdquo; and people still answered with the second choice.</p>

<p>‘but she can’t just be a bank teller; read the description.’</p>

</h2><p>Statistical base rates are underweighted, but if you apply causality to them, it can be easily combined with the information in an individual case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night.
Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.
You are given the following data:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.
<ul>
<li>Implication: <strong>85% of accidents involve green cabs</strong> (causal)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green?</p>
<p>Although our brain is tempted to write off the initial statistic, we need to apply <em>Bayesian inference</em> which results in a Bayesian estimate of 41%.</p>
<p>Solve for: Probability Blue given witness testimony</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-math" data-lang="math">- P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of the cab being Blue)
- P(G) = 0.85 (prior probability of the cab being Green)
- P(W|B) = 0.80 (probability of the witness identifying the cab as Blue if it was Blue)
- P(W|G) = 0.20 (probability of the witness identifying the cab as Blue if it was Green)
P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|G) * P(G)]
P(B|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
